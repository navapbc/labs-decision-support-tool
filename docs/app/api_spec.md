# For discussion

## Questions (Nava)

- Do we need the security key? What are the risks to leaving the API open?
- What kind of user information would be helpful to track with each request?
  Some possibilities we identified include user_id, org_id, customer_id, and session_id
- Does this endpoint schema make sense? Are there any changes we should make before implementing this as a v1? (Keeping in mind we can adapt over time as needed.)
