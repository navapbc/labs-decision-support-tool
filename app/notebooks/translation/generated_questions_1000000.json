The benefit amount and rules about using leave credits vary based on your employment status and bargaining unit.If you participate in the California\u2019s annual leave program, you are eligible to receive Enhanced NDI (ENDI) benefits of 50% of your gross pay. This can be supplemented with leave credits at 75% or 100%.State and federal taxes will be withheld from NDI benefits. Voluntary deductions, such as health insurance premiums, credit union loans, savings accounts, bonds, and parking fees, will automatically be deducted from NDI benefits unless you cancel. If you continue to deduct your health insurance premium, your employer\u2019s contribution will also continue.### Get a Medical CertificationMedical certifications are required for disability and caregiver claims to receive NDI or NDI-FCL benefits.Unlike SDI, NDI is not an automated program.

    "Disability Insurance (DI) is a part of the [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/About_the_State_Disability_Insurance_SDI_Program/) program. It provides partial wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers who are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy. SDI contributions are paid by California workers through employee payroll deductions.DI does not provide job protection, only monetary benefits; however, your job may be protected through other federal or state laws such as the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) or the [California Family Rights Act (CFRA)](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I6A8A63F05A0A11EC8227000D3A7C4BC3&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)).## Disability InsuranceDisability is an illness or injury, either physical or mental, which prevents you from performing your regular and customary work.

    "## About Disability Insurance BenefitsDisability Insurance (DI) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers.The most you can receive is 52 weeks of DI benefits, for your own non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy. Your disability must also be certified by a physician/practitioner.## Calculating Benefit Payment AmountsYour Weekly Benefit Amount (WBA) depends on your annual income. It is estimated as 60 to 70 percent of the wages you earned 5 to 18 months before your claim start date and up to the maximum WBA.Note: Your claim start date is the date your disability begins.We will calculate your WBA using a base period. To receive these benefits, you must have paid into State Disability Insurance during your base period and meet eligibility requirements. You will see this listed as \u201cCASDI\u201d on your paystub.### What is My Base Period?Review the following to find your base period.#### 1. Confirm your claim start date.Your claim begins the date your disability began. Your start date determines your base period.You **cannot** change the beginning date of your claim or adjust your base period after establishing a valid claim. If you have questions about your claim start date, call us at 1-800-480-3287 before filing your claim.#### 2. Find your base period.Your benefit amount is based on the quarter with your highest wages earned within the base period.A base period covers 12 months and is divided into four consecutive quarters. The base period includes wages subject to SDI tax that were paid about 5 to 18 months before your disability claim began. The base period does not include wages paid at the time your disability begins. For a DI claim to be valid, you must have at least $300 in wages in the base period. The following information may be used to determine the base period for your claim.If a claim begins on or after January 1, 2022:**January, February, or March:**  \nThe base period is the 12 months ending last September 30.  \nExample: A claim beginning February 14, 2022, uses a base period of October 1, 2020, through September 30, 2021.**April, May, or June:**  \nThe base period is the 12 months ending last December 31.  \nExample: A claim beginning June 20, 2022, uses a base period of January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021.",

  [
    "**July, August, or September:**  \nThe base period is the 12 months ending last March 31.  \nExample: A claim beginning September 27, 2022, uses a base period of April 1, 2021, through March 31, 2022.**October, November, or December:**  \nThe base period is the 12 months ending last June 30.  \nExample: A claim beginning November 2, 2022, uses a base period of July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022.You can get a general estimate by using our online calculator.[Estimate My Benefit Amount](/en/disability/PFL_Calculator/)**Note:** The calculator is intended to provide an estimate only. Your actual WBA will be confirmed once your claim has been approved.### How Your Weekly Benefit Amount is CalculatedIf your highest quarterly earnings are:* Less than $929, your WBA is $50.\n* Between $929 and $7,154.32, your WBA is approximately 70 percent of your earnings.\n* More than $7,154.33, your WBA is approximately 60 percent of your earnings.## What Affects Your Payment Amounts?Your benefits may be reduced if you:* Have a [benefit overpayment](/en/claims/Benefit-Overpayments/) for a previous Unemployment Insurance, Paid Family Leave, or DI claim.\n* Have late court-ordered child or spousal support payments due.\n* Are working [part time, intermittently, or reduced hours](/en/disability/part-time_intermittent_reduced_work_schedule/).### Payment amounts for part-time workersYou may still be eligible for benefits if you\u2019re working part time during your disability period. If your part-time wages and benefits combined exceed your regular weekly wages, your weekly benefit amount (WBA) may be reduced.Here are examples to help you determine if you qualify for a reduced (partial) or full WBA. In both examples, we use regular weekly wages of $1,000 and an estimated WBA of $600.#### Reduced WBA* Regular wages: $1,000 per week\n* Part-time wages: $500 per week\n* Estimated WBA: $600",
    "What is the base period for a claim that begins in October?"

  [
    "**Calculation:** $500 part-time wages + $600 WBA = $1,100. This amount **exceeds** the regular wages of $1,000 per week by $100. So you would be eligible for a **partial** **WBA** of $500 ($600 WBA - $100 over your regular wage).#### Full WBA* Regular wages: $1,000 per week\n* Part-time wages: $300 per week\n* Estimated WBA: $600**Calculation:** $300 part-time wages + $600 WBA = $900. This **does not exceed** the regular wages of $1,000 per week. So you would be eligible for the **full WBA** of $600.**Note:** Report all of your income to avoid overpayment, penalties, and a false statement disqualification.### Do You Have Other Circumstances?You can ask for a special base period, if your current base period was negatively affected by:* Military service\n* Industrial disability\n* Trade dispute\n* Long-term unemployment[Contact DI](/en/disability/Contact_SDI/) at 1-800-480-3287 to provide additional information if:* You do not have enough base period wages.

    "At the EDD, we are dedicated to fighting fraud and protecting benefits for California workers in need.During the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced an unprecedented surge of fraud attempts, particularly in new, federal pandemic benefit programs, which lacked traditional safeguards in an effort to get benefits to workers who needed them. We responded by developing and implementing a strategic plan to:* Detect and prevent fraud and other criminal activities.\n* Investigate and prosecute criminals.\n* Recover lost funds.\n* Help victims of identity theft related to benefit claims.Since 2020, our efforts have prevented more than $125 billion in attempted fraud. We encourage our claimants to remain vigilant and safeguard financial and personal information to help prevent fraud, including identity theft. To learn more, [visit Help Fight Fraud](https://edd.ca.gov/en/about_edd/fraud/).## Fraud PreventionWe work with local, state, and federal law enforcement to prevent fraud, hold fraudsters accountable, and recover lost funds for the Department and taxpayers.  ### Our Investigations DepartmentOur Investigations Department investigates cases and partners with local, state, and federal investigators and prosecutors. Since 2020, with our assistance, law enforcement has opened nearly 1,800 investigations, hundreds of suspects have been arrested, and many have been criminally charged and convicted.### Fraud Special CounselCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom appointed former two-time U.S. Attorney and elected District Attorney McGregor Scott to serve as our Fraud Special Counsel. Scott and his team help leverage our data sources and cutting-edge data analytics to identify and refer cases to law enforcement agencies for investigation and prosecution. To date, they have referred cases representing more than $223 million in fraudulent payments.In addition, the team:* Advises our leadership, Investigations Department, and Legal Office on fraud prevention strategies.\n* Enhances our ability to recover and return lost funds.\n* Works closely with the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Labor to identify and coordinate potential criminal investigations in California.",

    "The Fraud Special Counsel works with the California Office of Emergency Services (CalOES) PUA/COVID Task Force. Through the CalOES, $5 million was provided to reimburse District Attorneys\u2019 offices for expenses related to investigating and prosecuting pandemic unemployment fraud. In June 2022, the Legislature approved an additional $5 million to be distributed by the EDD to the District Attorneys\u2019 offices. In addition, the Legislature approved a separate $5 million to be distributed to state and local law enforcement through the High Technology Theft Apprehension and Prosecution Program.### Federal COVID-19 Strike ForceThe Biden Administration established three COVID-19 Strike Force teams across to country to target pandemic fraud with an emphasis on transnational and organized crime rings.  One of the Strike Force teams is in California and consists of representatives from various federal law enforcement agencies including the U.S. Department of Labor \u2013 Office of Inspector General and the FBI.  EDD\u2019s Investigations Department is the only state or local agency on the Strike Force team and its participation enables the California Strike Force to quickly and effectively identify and prosecute pandemic fraud.  ### Partnering with Law EnforcementWe have created investigative guides for law enforcement and offer technical assistance to our partners working these cases. We have set up regional contacts for each division of the State and work with agencies that need assistance with unemployment fraud cases.  We have also set up a system where out-of-state state and local law enforcement agencies can obtain information from EDD to investigate and prosecute UI fraud in their jurisdiction.## New Technology and ToolsWe have invested in new technology and tools to prevent fraud and catch fraudsters in the act.### Our Identity Verification System, ID.meTo prevent identity fraud at the start of the application process, we launched a new identity verification system, ID.me. This new system has stopped more than $125 billion in attempted fraud.In addition, our Special Counsel worked with ID.me to refer cases of fraudulent claims to law enforcement agencies. These cases represent more than $54 million in fraudulent payments. ### Using Data Analytics to Identify and Refer Criminal CasesWe have partnered with vendors and data scientists to identify potentially fraudulent claims using cutting-edge data analytics and to refer these cases to law enforcement agencies for further investigation and potential criminal prosecution. To date, utilizing work performed by ID.me, Accenture, and Thomson Reuters Special Services, we have referred cases representing more than $223 million in fraudulent payments.",

    "### Other Fraud Prevention ToolsWe have partnered with Thomson Reuters to cross-check unemployment applications against law enforcement databases. Between October 2020 and January 2021, this effort stopped at least $60 billion in potential fraud. Other actions that we have taken to fight fraud include:* Setting up a 1099-G call center to help victims of identity theft deal with any tax-related questions.\n* No longer printing Social Security numbers on mailed documents to reduce the risk of identity theft.\n* Working with Bank of America to:\n\t+ Issue chip-enabled debit cards that enhance security.\n\t+ Strengthen fraud-prevention strategies.\n* Working with the CalOES PUA/COVID Task Force on thousands of active investigations, arrests, and prosecutions for unemployment fraud including setting up agreements to ensure seamless sharing of information.\n* Delivering multiple customer alerts about text message and other phishing schemes.## Recovering and Returning Lost FundsAfter a criminal conviction, we seek and are entitled to court-ordered restitution to compensate the EDD as a fraud victim. This restitution can include the return of fraudulently obtained funds seized during a criminal investigation.  To date, we have obtained restitution orders for nearly $20 million in pandemic-related fraud.In addition, we are working with experts in restitution and asset recovery and upgrading our process to recover stolen funds by all available means. We will continue to seek and recover fraudulently obtained funds, including through administrative actions, forfeiture, and other means.Money recovered to date also includes unemployment funds from inactivated benefit cards. Most of these funds were related to the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program and under President Biden\u2019s Pandemic Anti-Fraud Proposal, the EDD will be able to continue recovering funds.

When someone files an Unemployment Insurance claim, we ask for identifying information. We notify the last employer, former employers, and current employers when a claim is filed. Employers also help us determine if a claim was filed by the correct person.The following documents help us prevent fraudulent claims:* [*Notice of Unemployment Insurance Claim Filed* (DE 1101CZ) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de1101cz.pdf) (sent to the last employer when a UI claim is filed).\n* [*Notice of Wages Used for Unemployment Insurance Claim* (DE 1545) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de1545.pdf) (sent to base period employers when benefits are paid).\n* [*Benefit Audit*  (DE 1296B)  (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de1296b.pdf) (sent to an employer who reports wages for a Social Security number during the same calendar quarter that UI benefits were paid under that Social Security number).Review [Benefit Audit Forms](/en/unemployment/Completing_Benefit_Audit_Forms/) for information on how to respond to certain forms you may receive from the EDD.## [I already responded to a Department notice about one of my employees.

    "There may be instances where a claimant on indefinite layoff is subsequently told to return to work on a fixed date. In this situation, the layoff is still considered an indefinite layoff for purposes of determining whether or not the holiday pay should be considered wages. For example, the claimant was initially laid off effective Monday, May 19, for an indefinite period. After two weeks, on June 2, the employer called and told him to return to work the following Monday, June 9. On June 4, the claimant was paid holiday pay for Memorial Day, May 26. Even though the claimant was called back to work on a fixed date, it does not change the original layoff status. The recall to work is considered an offer of new work. The holiday pay the claimant received on June 4 is not considered wages.On the other hand, a claimant placed on a fixed layoff may later be placed on an indefinite layoff. In such a situation, the resolution of the holiday pay issue will depend on whether the claimant is paid for the holiday prior to or after the notification of the indefinite layoff.Once the notification is made, the employer-employee relationship is considered severed at that point. Accordingly, if the claimant is paid prior to the notice, the employer-employee relationship has not been severed at that time and, therefore, the payment is considered wages. If he is paid after the notice, the holiday pay is not considered wages, because the claimant has already been terminated at the time the holiday payment was made.For example, the claimant was laid off on July 2 with a fixed return to work date of July 16. However, because the company lost a contract, the claimant was notified on July 9 that he would be placed on an indefinite layoff. On July 11, the claimant was paid holiday pay for July 4. Even though the claimant was initially laid off for a definite period, he received the notice of indefinite layoff prior to the date of payment for the holiday and, therefore, the holiday pay is not considered wages. The employer-employee relationship was terminated when he received the notice of indefinite layoff.- Allocation of Holiday Payments",

(The beginning date of a claim can be adjusted to meet this requirement.) They must remain under care and treatment to continue getting benefits.\n* A licensed health professional must complete the medical certification of their disability.  \t+ A nurse practitioner can certify to a disability within his/her scope of practice. However, he/she must perform a physical examination and collaborate with a licensed physician or surgeon.\n\t+ A licensed midwife, nurse-midwife, or nurse practitioner may complete the medical certification for disabilities related to normal pregnancy or childbirth.\n\t+ If your employee is under the care of an accredited religious practitioner, they may download and print the [*Claim for Disability Insurance Benefits-Religious Practitioner\u2019s Certificate* (DE 2502) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de2502.pdf).",

Your employee might not be eligible for DI benefits if they:* Are claiming or receiving Unemployment Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits.\n* Became disabled while committing a crime resulting in a felony conviction.\n* Are in jail, prison, recovery home, or any other place because they were convicted of a crime.\n* Are receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits at a weekly rate equal to or greater than the DI rate.\n* Fail to have an independent medical examination when requested to do so.\n* Are in an alcoholic recovery home or drug-free residential facility that is not licensed and certified by the state in which the facility is located.## Paid Family LeaveEmployees may be eligible for Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits if they lose wages when they need to take time off work for family leave.### Eligible for PFL BenefitsEmployees covered by DI are also covered for PFL. If a Voluntary Plan insurer provides your company\u2019s DI coverage, then it must also provide PFL coverage.An employee may submit a claim for PFL insurance benefits for the following reasons:* To care for a seriously ill child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner.\n* To bond with a new child entering the family through birth, adoption, or foster care placement of the child with the employee or the employee\u2019s spouse or registered domestic partner.\n* To participate in a qualifying event because of the military deployment of their spouse, registered domestic partner, parent, or child to a foreign country.To qualify for PFL benefits, your employee must meet the following requirements:",

    "Once it is determined that the claimant is on a definite layoff and, therefore, that the holiday pay is wages, allocation of these wages must be made. Section 1265.6 states in part, \". . . payments . . . for holiday pay for any holiday occurring in a week during which the individual was unemployed shall be deemed wages received for the week in which the individual returns to work, if holiday pay is not paid until the individual returns to work . . . for the week in which the holiday falls, if holiday pay is paid prior to the individual's return to work . . . .The first consideration is whether the claimant was unemployed during the week of the holiday. If the claimant was fully employed or had excessive earnings during that week, then the holiday pay is allocated to that week. If the claimant was not fully employed or did not have excessive earnings during that week, then it depends on when the holiday pay is paid relative to the date the claimant returns to work. If the holiday pay is paid after the claimant returns to work, the holiday pay is allocated to the week in which he or she returns to work. If the holiday pay is paid prior to the date the claimant returns to work, it is allocated to the week in which the holiday falls.Example:The claimant filed a claim effective December 21 when he was temporarily laid off due to a plant shutdown caused by a drop in work orders. He last worked Friday, December 19, and was scheduled with other employees to return to work on Monday, January 5.The payroll period ended on Friday and the company paid weekly on Tuesday. The company policy also provided for holiday pay for December 24, 25, and 31 and for January 1. The company issued paychecks on December 30 for the payroll period ending December 26 and on January 6 for the payroll period ending January 2. The paycheck issued on December 30 included the holiday pay for December 24 and 25, and the check issued on January 6 included the holiday pay for December 31 and January 1.Since the claimant was on a definite layoff, the holiday pay is wages. The claimant was also unemployed during the week of the holidays. The holiday pay for December 24 and 25, was paid prior to the claimant's returning to work and is therefore allocated to the week in which the holidays occurred, i.e., the week ending December 27.",

    "# Trade Dispute TD 5## Basic Principles### A. GeneralThis reference provides guidance for those Department personnel involved in the first and/or second level fact finding and decision making process in trade disputes.First level fact finding and decision making is the responsibility of the Area and Central Office Trade Dispute Specialists. The Field Office Trade Dispute Specialists may also be called upon for assistance. Additionally, our Legal Office is consulted on the more complex trade disputes.In first level fact finding, the facts on the trade dispute are obtained by contacting the employer and union involved. The facts and the overall decision on the eligibility of the various categories of claimants are then issued to the field offices in the Trade Dispute Notice.The primary purposes of this centralization of the fact finding and decision making process are to minimize Department contacts with the employer and union and to ensure consistency in the decisions issued.In second level fact finding and decision making, the field office claims interviewer conducts the fact finding with the claimant (the determination interview) and issues the decision on the individual claimant, following the guidelines in the Trade Dispute Notice.This reference provides guidance for both levels of the fact finding and decision making process; however, there are certain subjects which are of importance primarily to those individuals involved in the first level fact finding and decision making process. Such areas as deciding whether or not there is a trade dispute in existence within the meaning of Section 1262 and deciding whether or not a trade dispute has ended are entirely the responsibility of the Area and Central Office Trade Dispute Specialists. These specialists would also be expected to have a more in-depth knowledge of the other Federal and State laws, e.g., National Labor Relations Act, Agricultural Labor Relations Act, etc. The federal preemption argument discussed in TD 320 is a position sometimes taken by attorneys representing the union on appealed cases. The Area Trade Dispute Specialist or our Legal Office would normally present the Department\u2019s position on this type of issue.Those who are not involved in first level fact finding and decision making, however, should have an awareness of the subject matter so they may be able to logically follow the guidelines provided in the Trade Dispute Notice on the more routine type of questions from claimants, unions, and employers on individual claims actions.### B. Legal ProvisionsCUIC Section 1262 states:",

    "\"An individual is not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits, and no such benefit shall be payable to him, if he left his work because of a trade dispute. Such individual shall remain ineligible for the period during which he continues out of work by reason of the fact that the trade dispute is still in active progress in the establishment in which he was employed.\"Accordingly, Section 1262 provides that a claimant is ineligible for benefits under the following conditions:* A trade dispute exists.\n* The claimant left the work due to the trade dispute.\n* The claimant is still out of work because the trade dispute is in active Progress.Unlike the provisions of Section 1256, which provides that a claimant may establish good cause for voluntarily quitting a job, there are no good cause provisions in Section 1262. If a claimant is found to have voluntarily left the job due to a trade dispute, the claimant is ineligible for benefits.CUIC Section 1262.5 states:\"Whenever the department learns that trade a dispute is in progress, the department shall promptly conduct an investigation and make investigation findings as to the nature, location, labor organization and employers involved, and other relevant facts concerning the trade dispute as it deems necessary. The department shall provide its findings to its field offices in locations affected by the trade dispute, and shall, upon request, make its findings available to any employer, employers\u2019 association or labor organization involved in the trade dispute. The department\u2019s investigation findings shall be based upon the information then available to it and shall not be a determination as to the eligibility of any claimant for benefits under Section 1262.\"Accordingly, CUIC Section 1262.5 provides the Department shall:* Investigate trade disputes promptly.\n* Provide the findings to its field offices. This is done through the issuance of the Trade Dispute Notice.\n* Make its findings available to the employer and union involved in the dispute upon request, and\n* Provide that its findings shall not be considered a determination on the eligibility of an individual claimant under Section 1262. The individual circumstances of a particular claimant must always be taken into consideration.### C. Definition of a Trade DisputeThe term \"trade dispute\" is not defined in the UI Code. In PB 24, the Board provided the following definition as contained in the Norris-Laguardia Act:",
    "What are the conditions under which an individual is ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits due to a trade dispute, according to Section 1262?"
  ],
  [
    "\"The term \"labor dispute\" includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer or employee.\"The Board, in PB 24, also stated:\"The term \"labor dispute\" is a broad one and may be properly applied to any controversy which is reasonably related to employment and to the purpose of collective bargaining (Benefit Decisions Nos. 5527 and 5719). It is broader than \"strike\" or \"lockout\" (Benefit Decision 4838), and the existence of a trade dispute is not dependent upon the stoppage of work . . . .\"Accordingly, the following factors must be present for the Department to declare the existence of a trade dispute:* A controversy concerning terms and conditions of employment.\n* A union or group of employees involved in a concerted action against an employer due to the controversy.The presence of pickets and/or a walkout does not necessarily indicate there is a trade dispute. It is not uncommon for unions to establish \"informational\" picket lines. An \"informational\" picket line is established for the purpose of advising the public the employer does not have a union contract or is selling goods produced by a struck or nonunion employer. There are no negotiations between the union and the employer concerning terms and conditions of work. The union has not presented demands to the employer. An \"informational\" picket line, by itself, would be an insufficient basis to conclude there is a trade dispute. Accordingly, if a claimant refuses to cross an \"informational\" picket line, the claimant\u2019s leaving of his/her job would be resolved under the voluntary quit provisions of Section 1256.### D. Most Recent WorkUnlike Section 1256 which limits a disqualification only to a separation from the claimant\u2019s most recent work prior to the filing of a claim, a disqualification under Section 1262 may be assessed even though the trade dispute employer is not the claimant\u2019s most recent employer.",
    "What factors must be present for the Department to declare the existence of a trade dispute?"
  ],
  [
    "Section 1262 may be applied to any work the claimant left because of a trade dispute if the claimant continues to be out of work because of the trade dispute. E.g., claimant leaves a job because of a trade dispute and later obtains stopgap temporary work which lasts four days and is laid off due to lack of work. He then files a claim for benefits. Although the temporary job was his most recent work, the claimant would be subject to disqualification under Section 1262 for leaving the prior job due to a trade dispute. It is possible to purge a trade dispute disqualification with bona fide subsequent work; however, in this case, the temporary work was stopgap and therefore did not serve to purge the disqualification. The purging of trade dispute disqualifications is discussed in TD 370.### E. Department\u2019s Neutral PositionThe Department will not intervene in a trade dispute, nor in any way try to settle the dispute, or make any decision as to who is at fault. No decision of the Department as to whether a certain claimant is eligible or disqualified will be predicated on the merits of the trade dispute.The California Supreme Court touched on this matter in the Grace case, stating:\"It is not the function of the Commission (Department) to evaluate the merits of a controversy between an employer and his employees; if a trade dispute exists and the employee leaves his work because of it, he may not receive benefits even though his employer is in the wrong . . . .\"### F. Theory of AgencyThis discussion involves the effect of action taken by union officials which affect the eligibility for benefits of the individual members under the theory of agency. In this situation, the members of the union who are represented by their union official are bound by the actions of the union official. In some instances, the individual members of the union may not be aware of the union official\u2019s action.In BD 4615, the business agent of the claimants\u2019 union was acting as their representative when he led the employer to believe the claimants would not work during the trade dispute. The employer had asked the union business agent if the members of the bakery drivers\u2019 union would be willing to deliver bread produced by a bakery which was involved in a trade dispute with a union of the same national organization as the claimants\u2019 union. The claimants\u2019 business agent said the union members would not.The Board held the claimants disqualified under Section 1262. The Board said:",
    "What is the process by which a trade dispute disqualification can be purged according to the content provided?"
  ],
  [
    "\"The preponderance of the evidence herein shows that the claimants\u2019 failure to work . . . was the result of their acceding to the position asserted for them by their business agent. According to the evidence, he was empowered to act for them in dealings with their employer in matters concerning labor relations. The condition under which the employer desired the claimants herein to work . . . was a labor relation problem and a matter the agent was authorized to speak on for them with the employer. In the instant case, he clearly was acting in a responsible capacity on their behalf and as their representative when he, for all practical purposes, led the employer to believe that the claimants would not perform any work during the progress of a trade dispute . . .The evidence herein further shows that the employer had arranged to provide work for the claimants prior to their next regular working day but did not do so when it became apparent that the claimants would not perform it. The product produced by the employer . . . was of a highly perishable nature and it would have been absurd to require the employer to manufacture its products to subject the claimants to a work test. Furthermore, the law does not require an idle act.\"The McKinley court case is another prime example of the theory of agency. In this case, the employer association was negotiating a master contract with the union. During the negotiations, the employer representative informed the union official that strike action against one employer would be considered a strike against all employers in the association, i.e., if the union struck one employer, the other association employers would lock out the members of the union. Subsequently, one employer was struck and all other employers shut down within a few days. See TD 60 for further discussion of the McKinley case.The court held that all members of the union were subject to disqualification under Section 1262. Although the individual members of the union may not have been aware that the union official had been forewarned that a strike against one would be considered a strike against all, they were, nevertheless, bound by the notice to the union official. The court held that once the warning was given to the union official, it was reasonably foreseeable that all of the union members directly involved would become unemployed when they decided to initiate strike action against the one employer.",

    "# Voluntary Quit VQ 40## Attendance at School or TrainingThis section discusses the effect upon unemployment insurance of leaving a job to attend school. The leaving of work may be motivated by the claimant's desire for self-improvement or may be required by the employer or by law. While each claimant's circumstances are unique to him/her, only one of two results is possible: the claimant is either eligible or ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits. For discussion of related availability issue, see AA 40.### A. General RuleA claimant's desire to attend school is commendable but not compelling.Title 22, Section 1256-5, provides:(b) General Rule. Voluntarily leaving the most recent work to enroll in or attend a school or a training course is not a compelling reason to constitute good cause within the meaning of Section 1256 of the code, except as provided. . .In *Perales v. Calif. Dept. of Human Resources*, a 1973 appellate court case, the claimant contended that he left his last employment with good cause in that he quit to attend school in order to improve his chances for future employment. In holding the claimant ineligible for benefits, the court stated:. . .[W]e cannot say that quitting a job to attend school, no matter how personally commendable the step may be, is an imperative and compelling reason of such magnitude as to render the claimant eligible for unemployment benefits . . . . However great may be society's interest in furthering a working man's education, we find nothing in the Unemployment Insurance Law to sanction this objective . . . . The unemployment insurance system cannot be used to subsidize an employee's education.But, as pointed out by the Perales court, explicit legislative authority may overcome a lack of good cause for quitting to attend school if certain preestablished conditions are met.### B. Legislative Exceptions to the General Rule1. California Training Benefits (CTB)\nUnemployment Insurance Code Section 1267 provides in part:. . .[B]enefits shall not be denied to an individual for any week because he or she is in training or retraining with the approval of the director . . . or for leaving his or her most recent work, if continuing the most recent work would require the individual to terminate his or her training or retraining course of instruction.",
    "What are the conditions under which a claimant may be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits after leaving a job to attend school or training?"
  ],
  [
    "Title 22, Section 1256-5(c) (2), provides:[Good cause to leave employment exists if:] Prior to obtaining the most recent work, the individual has been enrolled in a retraining or training course, . . . conducted in California and scheduled on a full-time basis under the requirements of the particular institution, approved by the director under Section 1267 of the code, continuing the work would require termination of the retraining or training course, and the employer does not or cannot adjust the individual's hours of work to allow continuation of the work and the retraining or training course.In P-B-466, the Board discussed the legislative intent behind the CTB section:The CTB program was created to assist people that are unemployed and, as a practical matter, unemployable. Generally, a person meeting certain eligibility criteria can receive training while receiving unemployment insurance benefits.For further discussion see California Training Benefits FOM. That manual reiterates that a quit to enter training is not covered by Section 1267; Section 1267 addresses only those who quit because they are unable to continue in employment because of their schooling. Also note that failure to exercise reasonable alternatives to leaving the employment may negate any good cause for leaving (e.g., a change in working hours to accommodate the schooling, or a change in school hours to accommodate the employment).\n2. Apprenticeship Training\nTitle 22, Section 1256-4, provides:An individual who leaves work to enter an apprenticeship program. . . does so with good cause if the following conditions exist:\t1. The apprenticeship program is fostered by the State of California.\n\t2. The new work is potentially as permanent as and potentially substantially better than the former work.An apprentice with an apprenticeship agreement negotiated with the Division of Apprenticeship Standards is considered to be eligible for benefits if he/she quits to enter apprenticeship training, if he or she is otherwise eligible.",
    "What conditions must be met for an individual to have good cause to leave employment in order to enter an apprenticeship program in California?"
  ],
  [
    "If the employer discharges an apprentice before he or she completes the apprenticeship program, conduct a determination based on the reason for discharge, not on failure to complete the training program. If, however, the claimant is terminated for failure to complete the apprenticeship program, consider termination for failure to meet employer requirements.\n3. On-the-Job Training Programs\nIn situations where there is no collective bargaining agreement, or the parties to a collective bargaining agreement request, the California Apprenticeship Council may work with entities such as EDD, the Department of Education, and the Board of Governors of the Community Colleges to foster and promote \"on-the-job\" programs other than apprenticeship. To qualify, the training program must supply:\t* Programs for journeymen in the apprenticeable occupations to keep them abreast of current techniques, methods, materials, and opportunities for advancement in their industry;\n\t* Programs in other than apprenticeable occupations for workers entering the labor market for the first time, or workers entering new occupations by reason of having been displaced from former occupations for economic, industrial, or technological scientific reasons; and\n\t* Where appropriate, joint employer-employee cooperation.\"On-the-job\" training refers to training confined to the needs of a specific occupation and conducted at the jobsite for employed workers. To determine if such programs are \"approved training\" within the meaning of UI Code Section 1267, interviewers should check with the office CTB Specialist or the local apprenticeship council.\n4. Training at the Employer's Request\nTitle 22, Section 1256-5(c), provides:An individual who voluntarily leaves the most recent work to attend a school or training course leaves with good cause if, at the time of leaving, . . .\t1. The employer has requested that the individual participate in a school or training course.If the employer initiates the separation for the claimant to attend school, the employer becomes the moving party to the separation.Example:The claimant was employed as a head waiter aboard a steamship. On arriving at the port, the claimant was approached by a representative of the employer. He offered the claimant work as a second steward on another ship. The new position required a preliminary training course and, following the completion of training, the claimant was assigned to the new vessel.",
    "What factors should be considered when determining the reason for an apprentice's discharge from an apprenticeship program?"
  ],
  [
    "The claimant's decision to leave was a direct result of his conversation with the employer representative. The employer was the moving party in the claimant's leaving the first ship, by making it plain that the employer wanted the claimant to take the job on the latter ship.Had the claimant suggested the training and had the employer merely agreed, the claimant would have been the moving party and the separation would have been a quit.\n5. California Compulsory Education Law\nTitle 22, Section 1256-5(c)(3), provides good cause for leaving work can be found if:The individual was legally required to attend school due to compulsory attendance requirements based on age and could not arrange to continue work for the same employer while attending school.Under the California Education Code, all persons between the ages of six and 18 are subject to compulsory full time education unless the minor has graduated high school, has a certificate of proficiency, or is exempted. Minors between ages 12 and 17 may hold part-time work permits. Minors ages 16 and 17 may work full time and attend continuation school (or other designated alternative) at least 4 hours per week if employed or 15 hours per week when not working.Youths under age 18 not enrolled in a school program do not qualify for work permits and are therefore not employable.### C. Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN)All counties have adopted and implemented a GAIN Act program for county welfare recipients on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The level of services and time required for GAIN training are established by the applicable county welfare department; the program is mandatory for some participants, and discretionary for others.It should be noted that GAIN legislation provides no \"blanket\" coverage as \"director approved training.\" For some participants it may be months following registration in GAIN before they engage in any actual vocational training. Others may never be able or willing to acquire the basic language, literacy, or other skills necessary to progress to jobs or job training components of the program.County eligibility workers may counsel AFDC recipients to quit a job involving fewer than 15 hours work per week, and in some cases fewer than 30 hours work per week, in order to maintain their welfare grants. Although the claimant may have been strongly influenced by instructions of his or her eligibility worker, the judgment of eligibility workers is not infallible, and should be accorded no greater weight than advice and counsel that any under-employed claimant might receive from a vocational counselor, teacher, friend, or relative.",
    "What circumstances may provide good cause for leaving work under California Compulsory Education Law?"
  ],
  [
    "If the job is otherwise suitable and the GAIN training may be accomplished around the working hours, a quit to participate in GAIN training will not automatically be considered to be with good cause. Accordingly, the eligibility of an AFDC recipient who quits employment to engage in GAIN \"training\" that may ultimately lead to better employment is to be resolved like that of any claimant who quits to enter school.If the GAIN component is such that it meets CTB approved training criteria, good cause could be found if continuing in employment would preclude completion of the approved training.### D. Basic Citizenship SkillsUnder Section 245A(b) of the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 an alien must demonstrate that he or she either:Meets the requirements of Section 312 (relating to minimal understanding of ordinary English and a knowledge and understanding of the history and government of the United States), orIs satisfactorily pursuing a course of study (recognized by the Attorney General) to achieve such an understanding of English and such a knowledge and understanding of the history and government of the United States.Inasmuch as federal law rehabilitates previously-illegal persons and requires that an alien adjust his or her status from temporary to permanent residence within given time frames or revert to the prior illegal status, schooling to comply with the requirements of IRCA will be considered a compelling activity rather than merely commendable. The usual strictures apply to any separation to attend school, however, if the claimant could have accomplished the required educational goals without resorting to a quit, the quit will be without good cause.### E. Employer Preemployment Training ClassSome employers operate their own \"schools\" for training or have future employees attend specialized vocational classes. Typical of such training arrangements are classes to demonstrate particular sales techniques, manufacturers' classes to familiarize the claimant with a product or the skills required to use or repair a product, or to acquaint the claimant with business or operating practices customary in that business. The instructional period may range from a matter of hours to several weeks and may be on the employer's premises or off-site. A secondary purpose of the training may also be to assess the claimant's qualifications and personal characteristics as an extension of the hiring interview, or to generate enthusiasm in the claimant for the product or the employment.",

    "The employer may pay no stipend at all, training-related expenses only, minimum wage, or an equivalent to full pay for the job the claimant will be doing once training is completed. The claimant may leave training for a number of reasons. If the claimant has received wages for the training, the leaving will be considered a voluntary quit and must be adjudicated under principles applicable to the reason for the claimant's leaving. If the claimant received expenses only, the leaving will be adjudicated as a suitable work issue.",

    "# Trade Dispute TD 120## Nonunion employees - Initial Work Stoppage Action### A. Honoring of Picket Lines by Nonunion EmployeesAn employer involved in a trade dispute may have both union and nonunion employees in its workforce. For example, the production workers are members of a union, while the clerical workers are not represented by a union. If the union members take strike action, the eligibility of the nonunion employees depends on whether or not they choose to voluntarily leave their work in support of the union members. If the nonunion employee elects not to report to work due to the trade dispute, the employee is considered to have adopted the trade dispute as his/her own and is subject to disqualification under Section 1262.On the other hand, if the nonunion employee is laid off due to lack of work caused by the trade dispute, the employee is not subject to disqualification under Section 1262. In the 1953 Chrysler court case, the production workers, members of the union directly involved, took strike action. Nonunion office workers were laid off at a later date due to lack of production. The court held the nonunion employees were eligible since there was no voluntary action to leave on their part.### B. No Union Trade DisputesBriefly stated, a trade dispute is defined as a controversy over conditions of work between a union or group of workers, acting in concert, and an employer. There is no requirement that a union must be involved in the trade dispute to meet the definition of a trade dispute.In PB 399, 20 employees, who were not represented by a union, expressed dissatisfaction with overtime and unsafe working conditions to their foreman. Subsequently, the president reprimanded the employees for poor work. On that same day, a Friday, the employees left work without advance notice. No picket line was established. On Monday morning, the striking employees returned to the employer\u2019s premises. At 9:30 a.m., the employees asked to see the president. At this point, the employees were terminatedThe employer contended there was no true trade dispute because there was no uniformity of thought amongst the employees as to their reason for leaving work; grievances were not communicated to the employer; and it was essential to examine the merits of the walkout.In holding there was a trade dispute within the meaning of Section 1262, the Board cited PB 24:",

    "\"The term \"trade dispute\" is a broad one and may be properly applied to any controversy which is reasonably related to employment and collective bargaining.\"The Board cited numerous NLRB cases which have addressed the question of when employees were considered to be engaged in a trade dispute, including the following:\". . .employees have the right to engage in concerted activities for their mutual aid or protection even though no union activity be involved or collective bargaining contemplated *(NLRB v. Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co.)*\"The Board added:\"Spontaneous work stoppages by employees to protest grievances concerning working conditions are protected concerted activities within the scope of the National Labor Relations Act (*Elam v. N.L.R.B.* (1968), 395 F. 2d 611, 67 LRRM 2625; *N.L.R.B. v. Phaostron Inst. & Elect. Co.* (1965), 344 F. 2d 855, 59 LRRM 2175). In *N.L.R.B. v. Washington Aluminum Co.* (1962), 370 US 9, 50 LRRM 2235) the Supreme Court of the United States held that the language of Section 7 of the Act (29 USC Section 157) is broad enough to protect concerted activities whether they take place before, after, or at the same time a demand is made. The U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, in *Electrokmec Design Co. v. N.L.R.B.* (1969), 70 LRRM 3257) held that employees who fail to present a specific demand at the time they walk out does not have to be the most reasonable choice of action available in order for the employees to be protected under Section 7 of the Act.\"The Board, in PB 399, then concluded that the claimant was discharged due to his participation in a trade dispute and that such action did not constitute misconduct under Section 1256.",

    "# Trade Dispute TD 60## Initial Work Stoppage ActionThis category contains a discussion of the various types of initial work stoppage actions and the principles governing a claimant\u2019s eligibility under Section 1262 when a claimant is involved in such action.### A. Strike Action - Voluntary LeavingBy far, the most common type of initial work stoppage action is strike action, i.e., walking off the job or refusing to report to work. The Court established in the Bodinson case that the claimant must have voluntarily left due to the trade dispute for the disqualifying provisions of Section 1262 to be applicable. The Court said:\". . . disqualification under the Act depends upon the fact of voluntary action, and not the motives which led to it. The legislature did not seek to interfere with union principles or practices. The act merely sets up certain conditions as a prerequisite to the right to receive compensation, and declares that in certain situations the worker shall be ineligible to receive compensation. Fairly interpreted, it was intended to disqualify those workers who voluntarily leave their work because of a trade dispute.\"Accordingly, when claimants take strike action by voluntarily leaving due to a trade dispute, the claimants are subject to disqualification under Section 1262. Unlike the voluntary leaving provisions of Section 1256, there are no good cause provisions in Section 1262. The final decision is not predicated on the merits of whether or not the claimants had compelling reasons for taking strike action.In the Chrysler court case of 1953, the production workers took strike action and were, therefore, disqualified under Section 1262. The office workers were laid off at a later date because of lack of production. The union office workers belonged to the same union as the production workers and could vote on whether or not to strike. They were disqualified since they voluntarily accepted the union\u2019s strike strategy. The nonunion office workers were not disqualified since they had no control or voice in the union\u2019s strategy.The above case indicates that members of the union directly involved who are laid off may be disqualified if they had a part in the union strategy. The nonunion office workers who were laid off were not disqualified since they had no control or voice in the union strategy. The court said:",
    "What conditions must be met for a claimant to be disqualified from receiving compensation under Section 1262 in relation to strike action?"
  ],
  [
    "\"Where a union uses the tactical maneuver of a strike against only one employer, and where a termination of employment is reasonably foreseeable by the use of such strategy, the consequent unemployment of nonstriking workers who are members of the union must be regarded as voluntary.\"In the Chrysler court case of 1962, the production workers struck and were disqualified. The employer laid off clerical workers and engineers who were part of the same amalgamated union but who had separate contracts and who had no right to vote on whether or not to strike. The claimants were considered eligible.Mere union membership is insufficient to disqualify a claimant under Section 1262. A disqualification requires voluntary action. In this case, the nonstriking union members had no vote on whether or not to strike.### B. Honoring of Picket LineA member of a union not involved in the trade dispute who refuses to cross a picket line due to a trade dispute is considered to have voluntarily left due to the trade dispute. The individual is considered to have adopted the trade dispute as his/her own. Consequently, the claimant is subject to disqualification under Section 1262.In the Bodinson court case, the Welder\u2019s union struck the employer and established a peaceful picket line. The claimants were members of the Machinist\u2019s union, which was not involved in the trade dispute, but they honored the picket line. The claimants maintained that they did not leave their work voluntarily, but were prevented from going to work by the picket line. The court held that they had made the choice not to cross the picket line and thus their unemployment, or leaving of work, was voluntary. The court said:",
    "What factors led the court to determine that the unemployment of nonstriking union members in the Chrysler case was voluntary?"
  ],
  [
    "\"As in Mark Hopkins, the situation before us involves unemployment resulting from a trade dispute. Although the claimant ceased performing services on or about June 1, 1985, that event was brought about by neither a voluntary leaving of work, a discharge, a lack of work, or anything other than a dispute regarding the terms and conditions of employment. Neither party had taken any affirmative action to sever the employment relationship.\"Inasmuch as a lockout preserves the employer-employee relationship, the work subsequently offered to the locked out employees is not \"new work\" and therefore not unsuitable under Section 1259a. If the claimants refuse the recall to work, they would be, in effect, voluntarily leaving their jobs due to the trade dispute at that point and would be subject to disqualification under Section 1262.### D. \"Wildcat Strike\"A \"wildcat strike\" is a strike over conditions of work by employees contrary to the advice or without the consent of their union. A \"wildcat strike\" meets the definition of a trade dispute. Inasmuch as the employees have voluntarily left due to a trade dispute, the employees would be subject to disqualification under Section 1262.Such strike action is normally not condoned by the union because there is usually an unexpired contract with a \"no strike\" clause. As a result of the violation of the \"no strike\" clause, the employer may discharge the striking employees. See MC 475 for resolution of the discharge issue.### E. Jurisdictional DisputeSometimes a dispute over which union is to represent workers in a plant or company will result in the cessation of work. This is a jurisdictional dispute and is a trade dispute within the meaning of Section 1262.The Board decided the issue of jurisdictional disputes in BD 3829. The claimants in this case were all cannery workers for Libby, McNeil and Libby. For a number of years prior to the period involved in this case, the employer operated under a collective bargaining agreement with the Teamsters Union, A. F. of L. Under this agreement, the employees at the cannery had been required to clear through the local A.F. of L. Union before being hired.Over a considerable period of time, a number of employees in the cannery had changed their union allegiance by joining the C.I.O. Union. All claimants who were involved in this appeal were members of the C.I.O. at the time that the controversy arose.",

  [
    "\"It is true that under the proper construction of the statute an employee who is prevented from working through no act of his own is entitled to compensation, for example, where he is barred by force from the premises where he has been working. But that is not the situation here. If the picket line was maintained within the limits permitted by law, as this one presumably was, no physical compulsion was exerted to prevent corespondents from working. They were unemployed solely because, in accordance with their union principles, they did not choose to work in a plant where certain of their fellow employees were on strike. Their own consciences and faith in their union principles dictated their action. This choice is one which members of organized labor are frequently called upon to make, and in the eyes of the law this kind of choice has never been deemed involuntary.\"The Board has consistently held to the principle enunciated in the Bodinson case. As the Board said in Benefit Decision 5805:\"Although the claimants were not interested in the trade dispute which led to the establishment of a picket line on March 2, 1951, the record is clear that they left their work on that day on their own initiative and without instructions from their employer. Under the circumstances, we hold that the claimants effectively made the trade dispute their own and that by their leaving they became subject initially to the ineligibility provisions of Section 56(a) (1262) of the Act (Bodinson Mfg. v. California Employment Commission.)\"The mere fact that there is a picket line and that the claimant does not cross it does not automatically make the claimant subject to disqualification. Unless the claimant is given the opportunity to make the choice of whether or not he or she will cross the picket line, he/she cannot be said to have left the work due to a trade dispute.",
    "What conditions must be met for an employee to be considered ineligible for compensation due to their decision not to cross a picket line?"
  ],
  [
    "In BD 5545, the claimant became unemployed when her employer was struck by a union other than the one that the claimant belonged to. The claimant reported to work shortly before 9 a.m., the hour she was to report for work, and found the door locked. She called the employer and he told her she might as well go home. There was a picket line at the establishment, and the claimant said that she would not have crossed the picket line in any case. The Board held that the claimant was laid off, and thus did not voluntarily leave her work due to the trade dispute. The Board went on to say:\"Although there is some evidence in the record that the claimant would have been unwilling to cross the picket line in order to go to work even though the employer had offered to put her to work, her attitude on this point is immaterial since she was not instructed to work.\"### C. LockoutsA lockout is a cessation of the furnishing of work to employees by the employer in an effort to obtain more desirable terms for the employer.1. Unilateral Lockout:\nA unilateral lockout occurs when the union directly involved has not given strike notice, but the employer decides to lock out members of the union directly involved. In a unilateral lockout, the claimants are not subject to disqualification under Section 1262.In the Coast Packing Company court case, the Butchers\u2019 union contract was to expire October 1, 1961. Sometime before this expiration date the employers requested the union to give advance notice of any strike action so the employers could avoid substantial economic losses that they had suffered in the past when abrupt strike action caused spoilage of fresh meat. When the union refused to give advance notice, the employers commenced an orderly shutdown on September 29th and laid off the employees.The court held that the employer\u2019s precautionary shutdown to protect inventory because the employer felt the union would strike at any time is insufficient to cause the disqualification of the laid off employees. There was no strike notice given by the union.",
    "What was the Board's determination regarding the claimant's unemployment in BD 5545?"
  ],
  [
    "In another meat packing case, Morrell and Company, the court followed the Coast Packing decision. In Morrell, the employer\u2019s contract with the Butchers\u2019 union was about to expire. The employees voted their representative the authority to call a strike, but set no date. The employer twice requested an extension of the contract or 72 hours\u2019 notice before strike action, but was refused.To protect itself against loss, the employer closed the plant to the union members and used supervisors and salesmen to dispose of the inventory and maintain the plant. No ultimatum had been given by the union to the employer. The union did not obtain necessary strike approval from higher authorities.The court held the claimants eligible within the meaning of Section 1262. It rejected the employer\u2019s argument that the threat of a strike had been increased to a reasonable certainty by a strike authorization vote and the refusal to either extend the contract or give strike notice.\n2. McKinley Lockout\nIn the McKinley court case, the Sacramento Wholesale Bakers\u2019 Association of seven members and the Bakery and Confectionary Workers union had bargained for a master contract since 1935. In the 1946 bargaining session, the employer association advised the union that if there was strike action against any member of the association the other employer members would lock out their bakery union members.The court held all of the claimants disqualified under Section 1262. The court stated that where there is collective bargaining between a union and employer association and the association notifies the union in advance that if there is a strike against any one member of the association the other employer members will lock out their union directly involved employees, the locked out employees are ineligible under Section 1262. The employer association\u2019s position is known as a \"strike against one is a strike against all\". The court reasoned that the unemployment of the bakery workers was caused by their own action taken with full knowledge of its consequences.McKinley Application - Limited LockoutIn the Gardner court case, the court held the McKinley rule applied even though the employer association lockout was not unanimous.",
    "What was the court's reasoning in the McKinley case regarding the eligibility of employees who were locked out due to a strike against one member of an employer association?"
  ],
  [
    "In Gardner, the Santa Clara County Restaurant Association, on April 28, 1955, notified the restaurant union that a strike against one employer would be considered a strike against all. There were 70 employers in the employer association (also 44 employers who were not members but had given the association authority to serve as their bargaining agent). On May 25, the union called a strike against 10 employers, and the association retaliated on the same day by notifying its members to lay off their employees the next day. The lockout was about 70 percent effective as to total number of employees affected; about 35 employer members had complete lockouts.McKinley Application - No Strike SanctionIn another court case, Artigues, the court held the McKinley rule applied even if the striking union did not have strike sanction from its international organization.In Artigues, in June 1963, the motion picture projectionists, member of Local 162 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Motion Picture Operators, commenced negotiations for a new master contract with the San Francisco Theater Owners\u2019 Association. During negotiations, the association advised the union that a strike against one would be considered a strike against all. On November 12, the union advised the association that a request for strike sanction from the union\u2019s international had been made but that no reply had yet been received. On November 13, the union struck two theaters, and the remaining theaters locked out their union employees.The claimants who were locked out contended they should not be responsible for the strike action of their fellow members because the strike was \"illegal\" since there had been no strike sanction granted from the international.The court replied:\"To hold, as respondents urge, that a local union and its members are not responsible for a strike called by their elected officers because no \"strike sanction\" was given would tend to encourage such \"illegal\" strikes. A local union could thus obtain for its members all of the fruits of a strike while at the same time the members and their union would be relieved of any responsibility therefor.\"McKinley Application - Two Locals Involved",

    "In PB 24, Boilermakers Local 6 in San Francisco and Local 10 in Oakland were represented by a single negotiating committee. During negotiations for the latest contract the employer association, the California Metal Trades Association, warned the unions that a strike against one would be a strike against all. Thereafter, On April 10, two employers were struck by Local 10 and one employer by Local 6. On that same day, the employer association warned the unions that a lockout of all employees would occur if all employees did not return to work immediately. On April 13, all Local 6 members returned to work but only some members of Local 10 returned to work. On April 17, the employer locked out all employees at the nonstruck plants.In holding the claimants disqualified under Section 1262, the Board said:\"It is not possible to separate the actions of Local No. 10 and Local No. 6 members. They acted as a unit in negotiations, and the employer representative had made it clear that the invitation to return to work was for all and not just some of the workers affected. It is perhaps unfortunate for members of Local No. 6, who were willing to return when CMTA offered to lift the lockouts, that their affairs were so intertwined with and indivisible from those of members of Local No. 10. These are the facts, however, and it was the choice of both locals that they be so aligned. We conclude that the actions of the members of both locals on and after the pivotal date of April 10, 1967 were voluntary, mutually binding, undertaken for a common goal and were acquiesced in, or not objected to, by union officers.\"Accordingly, the McKinley rule applies if there is a refusal to return to work by at least one of the locals in a union which is negotiating as a single entity for all of the locals.\n3. Lockout Followed By Recall to Work\nIn some cases, an employer who has unilaterally locked out the members of the union directly involved may subsequently recall the employees to work. Under these circumstances, the employees who were initially eligible under Section 1262 due to the unilateral lockout may then be subject to a trade dispute disqualification if they refuse to return to work due to the trade dispute.In PB 451, the employer was unable to reach a contract agreement with the union and therefore locked out the members of the union directly involved. The Board held that the employer-employee relationship was not severed during the lockout, stating:",
    "What actions led to the employer locking out all employees at the nonstruck plants on April 17, 1967?"

    "As the membership of cannery workers in the C.I.O. Union increased, demands were made on the employer\u2019s association for recognition of this organization as the bargaining agent for the cannery employees.The controversy was referred to the National Labor Relations Board. An election was held, but was inconclusive since neither union received a majority of votes. The National Labor Relations Board called for a new election, however, no such election had been held at the time of this dispute.Prior to March 1, 1946, (the expiration date of the A.F. of L. contract), the C.I.O. Union took no official action to dissuade its members from retaining membership in the A.F. of L. Union.On or about April 26, 1946, the employer advised all of its employees that a contract with the A.F. of L. Teamsters Union had been renewed. Also, that continued employment in the cannery would depend upon membership in the Teamsters Union, and that on or about April 29, representatives of the Teamsters Union would be present at the plant for the purpose of accepting applications for enrollment in the Teamsters\u2019 organization.The workers who were members of the C.I.O. Union, voted unanimously that they would refuse to pay dues to the Teamsters Union. Also, in the event the company brought the Teamsters\u2019 representatives into the plant that the workers would stop work. They further voted that they would remain at their jobs and notify the company that they would resume work as soon as the Teamsters\u2019 representatives were taken out of the plant and stopped bothering them.Two representatives of the A.F. of L. Teamsters Union came into the plant at about 8:45 a.m. on April 29, and the employees were advised that they must go to the office and pay dues to the Teamsters Union. The employer stated that in the event the workers refused to pay Teamsters\u2019 dues and refuse to return to work within 30 minutes of the time he finished speaking, he was going to close the plant and ship the produce to other canneries. No work was performed after 9:00 a.m. on that date.The Board held that this was a jurisdictional dispute, and therefore a trade dispute was in existence. The Board said:",
    "What actions did the workers who were members of the C.I.O. Union take in response to the employer's insistence on membership in the Teamsters Union?"

    "\"We find ample ground for holding that the dispute underlying the cessation of work at the Libby Plant on April 29, was a \u2019trade dispute\u2019 within the meaning of that term as used in Section 56(a) (1262) of the Act.The term \u2019trade dispute\u2019 is not defined in the Unemployment Insurance Act. There is no question that a strike or lockout originating over a difference of opinion between an employer and his workers concerning wages or hours falls within the definition of that term. But, we are here concerned with a more intangible conflict concerning the right of the workers to representation by one or the other of two labor organizations. That the definition is sufficiently broad to include more than strikes and lockouts, is clearly indicated in a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court, construing the meaning of the term \u2019labor dispute\u2019 in the Alaska Unemployment Compensation law.\"In the case of *Unemployment Compensation Commission of Alaska vs. Aragon*:\"The term \"labor dispute\" includes any controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether or not the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee.In light of this authority we conclude that a trade dispute within the meaning of the California Unemployment Insurance Act can be concerned with jurisdictional issues and with questions of representation of workers by labor organizations.\"Using the same line of reasoning, the Board said in Benefit Decision 4910:\"On August 18, 1946, the claimant\u2019s labor organization placed a picket line at the employer\u2019s establishment in protest of the employer\u2019s allegedly dismissing workers for refusal to join the Teamsters Union. It would appear, therefore, that a jurisdictional dispute was in progress between two rival labor organizations.\"### F. Slowdown/Sitdown StrikesWhen the employer is forced to close down because the employees have slowed down production, this is not a lockout. In this case, the claimant\u2019s own action brought about his/her unemployment.",
    "What constitutes a \"trade dispute\" under the California Unemployment Insurance Act, and how does it relate to issues of worker representation and jurisdictional conflicts between labor organizations?"
  ],
  [
    "In Benefit Decision 4588, the Board considered the question of a work slowdown. Negotiations concerning wages and hours had been in progress between the employer and the union. Two series of alleged work slowdowns had occurred during the period of negotiation. There was a 50 percent drop in production. The latest culminated in the suspension of operations by the employer and the establishment of a picket line by the claimants. The claimants contended that the closing of the plant was a lockout. The Board held that the claimants had voluntarily left their work due to a trade dispute:\"It is the contention of the claimants that they did not leave their work because of a trade dispute but on the contrary were locked out by their employer. We find it difficult to accede to this contention in view of the preponderance of evidence establishing a work slowdown by the claimants preceding the closing of the establishment.No support can be found for the argument of the claimants that they were without employment because they were locked out by their employer. It is well settled that a lockout exists when the employer ceases to offer work to his employees in an effort to obtain for himself more favorable or desirable terms from his employees. The employer in the instant case offered employment which was refused. In extending the offer he did not make any effort nor try to obtain in any way more favorable or desirable terms but only imposed as the sole condition that work be performed in the same manner as in the past. The facts in this case, fall far short of establishing a lockout.\"For sitdowns, where the employees remain in the plant but refuse to work, the shutdown of the plant by the employer would also not be viewed as a lockout. The employees would be considered to have left their work due to the trade dispute.### G. SickoutsSickouts are work stoppages in which the employees attempt to put pressure on the employer to acquiesce to their demands by not reporting to work, feigning illness.If the facts indicate the employees are participating in a sickout, they would be considered to have voluntarily left their jobs due to a trade dispute. Accordingly, they would be subject to disqualification under Section 1262. Factors which indicate the employees are participating in a sickout are as follows:",
    "What factors indicate that employees are participating in a sickout during a trade dispute?"
  ],
  [
    "* Number of employees involved. If a relatively large number of employees call in sick during the same period, the employees are probably participating in a sickout since it would be highly improbable they would all be sick during the same time.\n* Failing contract negotiations. Sickouts usually occur during a period when the employees are dissatisfied with the progress of the contract negotiations.\n* Illegality of taking direct strike action. The employees may be prohibited from taking direct strike action, i.e., walking off the job, by a \"no strike clause\" in a current contract. For certain government workers, they may be prohibited from taking strike action by federal or state law. Therefore, the foregoing employees may express their dissatisfaction by participating in a sickout. Sickout action, however, may also be considered illegal.\n* No medical verification of illness. If the employees do not have medical verification for their illness, this would indicate they may be participating in a sickout. If a claimant, however, indicates he/she did not report to work due to illness and has medical verification, the claimant should not be considered to have voluntarily left work due to the trade dispute. It should also be noted that if the employee does not report to work upon recovery due to the trade dispute, he/she would be subject to a trade dispute disqualification.### H. Intermittent Work StoppagesIntermittent work stoppages are repetitious walkouts within a relatively short span of time. Such walkouts often result in the discharge or suspension of the employees.In an NLRB case, *Honolulu Rapid Transit v. Transit Workers Union of Hawaii*, the union resorted to intermittent strike activities after the contract expired. The workers did not report to work on Saturdays and Sundays, which had the effect of seriously disrupting operations. After this continued for several weekends, the employer warned the employees that further refusals would mean a 15-day suspension. The employees continued their intermittent work stoppage and were thereafter suspended.The union contended the suspension was unlawful in that the company was compelling the strikers to work full-time or not at all, thus denying them the right to strike.The court held that:",

    "\"...an employer is not required, at the risk of prosecution, to alter and adjust his operating schedules and hours to the changing whim which may suit the employees\u2019 or a union\u2019s purpose. Establishment of work schedules is a responsibility (and prerogative) of the employer which may, of course, be the subject of bargaining. Employees may not, however, simultaneously accept and reject them, and thereby in effect establish and impose upon the employer their own conditions of employment.\"Accordingly, the court held that the intermittent work stoppages were not \"protected activity\" under the National Labor Relations Act and, therefore, there was no violation in the law when the employer suspended the employees.Under similar factual circumstances, for UI purposes, it would be considered there was a trade dispute in existence and the subsequent suspension would be considered a discharge for misconduct under Section 1256.### I. Sympathetic StrikeWhen employees stop working in sympathy with other employees, there is a trade dispute in existence. This is true even though the employees and their union may have no grievance with the employer. It is not necessary that the employees be members of or involved in the affairs of the striking union, if they leave their work out of sympathy, they have made the strike their own.In *W.R. Grace and Company v. California Employment Commission*, the longshoremen left their work because they would not work without checkers. The ship\u2019s clerks and checkers were on strike. The Court ruled that the longshoremen were involved in a trade dispute when it said:\"It was not essential to disqualification that a dispute exist directly between the longshoremen and the employer; if the former left their work because of the dispute between the employer and the ship\u2019s clerks, they in effect made the latter dispute their own and are within the disqualification of Section 56(a) (1262).\"",

    "In Benefit Decision 6398, a dispute arose between Kaiser Steel Corporation and Local 2869, the United Steel Workers of America. The incident causing the work stoppage arose because, on April 11, 1954, four powerhouse mechanics had been assigned to move a motor from the powerhouse to a nearby area. A dispute arose as to whether it was the responsibility of the powerhouse mechanics to move the motor or whether it should have been moved by the forge and wellrigging crew. The stoppage resulted from this dispute. On April 14, 1954, a grievance was filed under the procedure set up in the agreement. By Wednesday, April 21, 1954, no word had been received from the chairman of the union grievance committee, consequently, the powerhouse mechanics were again assigned the job of moving the motor in question. Mechanics asked for their timecards and stated they were \"going home.\" These four individuals and the other powerhouse mechanics left the job and the plant at approximately 8:30 a.m. on April 21, 1954. Shortly thereafter, the maintenance men began returning to their cleanup areas and started making preparations to leave the plant. Also, the employees in some of the rolling-mill units began making preparations to leave the job, and word was received by some supervisors that none of the rolling mills would be operating after 12 noon.In deciding whether a trade dispute was in existence, the Board cited several authorities. The Board stated:\"In attempting to frame a definition of \"trade dispute,\" this Board stated in Benefit Decision No. 5527:At the outset our inquiry must be directed toward ascertaining whether or not there was a trade dispute within the meaning of the above provision of law. The term \"trade dispute\" is not defined in the Unemployment Compensation Act nor is it defined in any other California statute. The only unemployment insurance law wherein we find the term \"trade dispute\" defined appears in Section 26 of the British Unemployment Insurance Act of 1935, and reads:\"Trade dispute\" means any dispute between employer and workmen, or between workmen and workmen, which is connected with the employment or nonemployment or with the terms of employment, or with conditions of labor, or any persons, whether workmen in the employment of the employer with whom the dispute arises or not.In *W.R.

    "# Total and Partial Unemployment TPU 5## GeneralThis category of the Total and Partial Unemployment (TPU) Division of the BDG contains a discussion of the general principles involved in determining whether a claimant is \"unemployed\" within the meaning of Section 1252 of the UI Code, and the amount of benefits payable under Section 1279 to an unemployed claimant who has earnings allocated to a week claimed.For more detailed discussions of these general principles, refer to the appropriate categories in this division.### A. Legal Provisions1. Section 1252\nUnder the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Code, a person must be \"unemployed\" to be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. The definition of \"unemployed\" for benefit eligibility purposes, is contained in Section 1252 of the Code which, in part, provides as follows:\" (a) An individual is 'unemployed' in any week in which he or she meets any of the following conditions:(1) Any week during which he or she performs no services and with respect to which no wages are payable to him or her.(2) Any week of less than full-time work, if the wages payable to him or her with respect to the week, when reduced by twenty-five dollars ($25) or 25 percent of the wages payable, whichever is greater, do not equal or exceed his or her weekly benefit amount . . .(4) Any week during which he or she performs full-time work for five days as a juror, or as a witness under subpoena.\"Based on the above provisions, an individual would not be unemployed in any week in which:\t* He/she performs services on a full-time basis (excluding work as a juror or as a witness under subpoena).OR",

    "\t* He/she performs no services, or only works part time, but he/she has wages payable which when reduced by $25 or by 25 percent of the wages (whichever is greater) equal or exceed his/her weekly benefit amount (WBA).It should be noted that a person may be employed, as that term is commonly construed, and still be \"unemployed\" for a UI eligibility purposes.\n2. Section 1279\nIf a claimant is unemployed, as defined above, but he/she has earnings allocated to a week claimed, and is otherwise eligible, the amount of benefits payable is calculated according to the provisions of Section 1279 of the UI Code. This section provides, in pertinent part:\"(a) Each individual eligible under this chapter who is unemployed in any week shall be paid with respect to that week an unemployment compensation amount less the smaller of the following:(1) The amount of wages in excess of twenty-five dollars ($25) payable to him or her for services rendered during that week.(2) The amount of wages in excess of 25 percent of the amount of wages payable to him or her for services rendered during that week.(b) The benefit payment, if not a multiple of one dollar ($1), shall be computed to the next higher multiple of one dollar ($1).\"This means that the first $25 or 25 percent (which is greater) of the wages allocated to a week will be disregarded. The amount remaining (i.e., earnings over $25 or 75 percent of the earnings, whichever is smaller) is deducted from the claimant\u2019s weekly benefit amount. If the deductible amount equals or exceeds the WBA, Section 1279 would not apply since the claimant would not be unemployed within the meaning of Section 1252.NOTE: Sections 1252 and 1279 do not apply to individual's claiming benefits under the Work Sharing Program. For such individuals, Section 1279.5 of the UI Code provides a separate definition of unemployed and a different method for calculating the reduced amount payable. See the Work Sharing Handbook for a complete discussion and special claim processing procedures.### B. Services PerformedOne area to be examined in determining whether an individual is unemployed within the meaning of Section 1252 is whether \"services\" were performed and, if so, whether such services were performed on a full-time basis.",

    "1. \"Services\" Defined\nIn *People v. Nest*, the court examined the meaning of \"services\" in order to determine whether a self-employed claimant was unemployed for UI purposes. At the time this case was decided, the applicable provisions of the law (Section 9.2 of the Unemployment Insurance Act) read: \"An individual shall be deemed 'unemployed' in any week during which he performs no services with respect to which no wages are payable, or in any week of less than full-time work if wages payable with respect to such week are less than his weekly benefit amount.\" Although this provision of the law has been replaced by Section 1252 of the UI Code, there has been no change in the language interpreted by the court in People v. Nest. Therefore, the following definition, as provided in that decision, is still applicable:\"The word 'service', not being defined in the act, must be given its common meaning, unless the context requires otherwise, which it does not. Merriam-Webster's New International Dictionary defines 'service' as, 'The occupation, condition, or status of a servant. Performance of labor for the benefit of another, or at another's command; - hired helper; - duty done or required.\"The court concluded that this definition did not cover the activities of the claimant in the running of his own business. Therefore, a self-employed person (or an independent contractor) would be considered unemployed regardless of the number of hours devoted to the operation of his/her business if the earnings from self-employment are not excessive ( XE ).(For a further discussion of self-employment, including guidelines for determining whether an individual is an employee or self-employed, see TPU 415. For a discussion of self-employment in terms of availability for work, see AA 415).In accordance with the definition of services provided above, an employer-employee relationship must exist before an individual can be held to be performing services. This does not mean, however, that if an individual is still attached to an employer, from the standpoint that there has not been a complete severance of the employer-employee relationship, he/she is necessarily performing services.",

    "Generally, the matter of whether services are being performed will be obvious since the individual will be engaged in some productive activity which is required or controlled by the employer. In some cases, however, the performance of services will be less apparent in that it will consist of some form of inactive duty. That services can also include periods of apparent inactivity or idleness is a principle of relative long-standing, and one which has been applied by the United States Supreme Court in a number of cases dealing with a variety of employment-related issues.For example, in *Missouri, Kansas, & Texas Railway Co. v. United States*, the U.S. Supreme Court held that periods of time in which employees were inactive because of problems with the employer's equipment should be counted in determining whether the employees had worked over the legally permitted number of hours. In discussing the periods of inactivity the court said:\"One of the delays was while the engine was sent off for water and repairs. In the meantime the men were waiting, doing nothing. It is argued that they were not on duty during this period . . . But they were under orders, liable to be called upon at any moment, and not at liberty to go away. They were none the less on duty when inactive. Their duty was to stand and wait.\"In *Armour & Co. v. Wantock*, the Supreme Court considered whether regularly occurring standby or idle time, which was required by the contract of employment, should be considered working time for the purposes of computing overtime pay. This case dealt with fire fighters who were required to be on the job site for 24-hour shifts, but who were only assigned specific duties for the first 9 hours. During the remaining 15 hours, these workers could eat, sleep, or engage in personal amusement but were required to remain on the employer's premises and to respond to alarms or other emergency situations at any time. In deciding that these 15-hour periods of apparent idleness constituted service to the employer, the court reasoned as follows:\"We think the Labor Standards Act does not exclude as working time periods contracted for and spent on duty in the circumstances disclosed here, merely because the nature of the duty left time hanging heavy on the employees' hands and because the employer and employee cooperated in trying to make the confinement and idleness incident to it more tolerable . . . .",
    "What principles have been established by the U.S. Supreme Court regarding periods of inactivity or standby time in relation to employee duties?"
  ],
  [
    ". . . an employer, if he chooses, may hire a man to do nothing or to do nothing but wait for something to happen. Refraining from other activity often is a factor of instant readiness to serve, and idleness plays a part in all employment in a stand by capacity. Readiness to serve may be hired as much as service itself, . . . \"The principles illustrated by the above two Supreme Court cases should not be applied to situations in which an individual is subject to be called to work by his/her employer but does not have to report to or remain on the employer premises and is not entitled to compensation for the period during which he/she is on-call.(For further discussion of situations involving services in a stand-by capacity, see TPU 80.05, TPU 105, and TPU 460.6.)The principle that inactive duty time can constitute services for an employer was more broadly applied by the Supreme Court in *Social Security v. Nierotko*. This case dealt with an individual who had received a backpay award because of a wrongful discharge. In holding that the award was remuneration for services performed, and that, therefore, it was wages for the purposes of computing benefits under the Social Security Act, the court stated:\"We think that 'service' means not only work actually done but the entire employer-employee relationship for which compensation is paid to the employee by the employer . . . .The decision of this Court leaves no doubt that a man's time may, as a matter of law, be in the service of another, though he be inactive . . . . When the employer is liable for backpay, he is so liable because under the circumstances, though he has illegally discharged the employee, he still absorbs his time . . . . he has reduced his employee to enforced idleness.\"(For further discussion of backpay awards, see TPU 80.05 and TPU 460.6).While these three Supreme Court cases did not deal with the payment of unemployment insurance benefits, the principles contained therein have been applied by the Appeals Board and the courts in California to cases involving eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits. Therefore, for purposes of determining eligibility under Section 1252, a claimant will be considered to be performing services during periods in which there is an employer employee relationship, AND:\t* The individual engages in productive activity for the employer;OR",

    "\t* The individual is required to hold himself/herself in readiness to work for the employer, and he/she receives, or is legally entitled to receive, compensation for such period(s);OR\t* The individual is not permitted to work by the employer, but he/she is granted a backpay award for such period(s).\n2. Full-Time Work\nIf an individual is performing services, as defined above, he or she is not unemployed within the meaning of Section 1252 if the services constitute \"full-time work\".a. General PrinciplesThere is no definition of \"full-time work\" in the UI Code, Title 22 of the California Administrative Code, or in precedent decisions of the Appeals Board or the California courts. Therefore, the Department has traditionally given this term its common meaning. Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"full-time\" as:\"Employed for or working the amount of time considered customary or standard.\"For the purposes of determining UI eligibility, full-time work in a week consists of the number of hours considered to be the standard or customary workweek for an occupation in a geographic or labor market area. In keeping with this broad, general definition the decision as to what is considered standard or customary would not be based on the employment history of a specific individual or on the practice of a particular employer. Furthermore, to the extent possible, there should be only one standard for each specific occupation in a geographic or labor market area. Therefore, if people who work in an occupation are employed in more than one industry in the area, what is considered the standard workweek should be based on the pattern in all of the industries and not merely on the pattern used by the industry in which the claimant has had the most recent or longest work experience. In attempting to identify the industry wide workweek for an occupation, one should focus on the type of work the claimant is performing (or performed during the week(s) in question) rather than on broad occupational categories. For example, the Dictionary of Occupational Titles groups doctors, accountants, and librarians into the same occupational category. One should not, however, consider the hours worked by other types of professional workers when determining the customary workweek of librarians.In determining what is the standard or customary workweek (i.e., full-time work) for an occupation, the appropriate factors below should be considered.",
    "What is the definition of \"full-time work\" according to the general principles outlined in the content?"
  ],
  [
    "(1) One indicator of what constitutes a week of full-time work is the number of hours worked per week by the majority of workers in an occupation during periods of normal workload.EXAMPLE AIn occupation A, individuals are hired to work hours ranging from 7 to 42 per week; however, the majority of people in this occupation work 35 hours per week year round. In the absence of other indicators, full-time work in this occupation would be 35 hours per week.EXAMPLE BIn occupation B, the majority of workers are employed 35 hours per week for 10 months of the year and for 42 hours per week in the remaining 2 months due to yearly workload increases. In this case, full-time work would be 35 hours per week, unless other factors indicate a different standard. This would also apply to the two-month period of increased working hours since normal workload periods are to be the basis for determining what is the customary workweek.EXAMPLE CIn occupation C, the majority of workers are employed 48 hours per week for 9 months of the year and laid off during the remaining 3 months. Some workers are retained - during the off-season and work 20 hours per week. For this occupation full-time work would be 48 hours per week, unless one of the other factors discussed below indicates a different standard. The fact that those employed during the off-season work only 20 hours per week does not result in a finding that the full-time standard would change from 48 to 20 hours during that period, since what is the customary workweek should be based on periods of normal workload and not on conditions during the off-season or periods of low workload. A fluctuating standard is considered particularly inappropriate in cases such as this since, one of the purposes of the unemployment insurance program is to partially alleviate the economic hardships resulting from involuntary loss of, or reduction in, employment.",
    "What is the basis for determining what constitutes full-time work in different occupations?"

  [
    "You are limited to working (number) of (hours/days) per week. You are working all of the hours that you are available.

Claimant Reports Work, Did Not Respond to Request for InformationOn your continued claim for the week(s) ending _________ you did not provide information about employment. You have not responded to our request(s) for information needed to decide your eligibility. The Department finds that there is not enough information to decide that you are unemployed.**II. ELIGIBLE**AA. No Services or Earnings (Section 1252)The claimant did not perform services or earn wages during the week(s) ending (enter dates). Therefore, the claimant was unemployed.",
    "What was the outcome of the claimant's report regarding employment due to the lack of information provided?"
  ],
  [
    "(2) A second factor to consider in determining what is full-time work in an occupation is whether there are any laws, regulations, collective bargaining agreement provisions, or industry practices concerning the payment of overtime pay for hours worked over a specified limit. If so, full-time work would be the maximum number of hours that an individual could work before becoming eligible for overtime pay (unless other factors indicate a different standard). For example, various Orders of the Industrial Welfare Commission (published in Title 8 of the California Administrative Code) provide that for some industries and occupations no employee shall be employed more than 40 hours in any workweek unless the employee is paid one and one half times his/her regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek. For occupations covered by such provisions, full-time work would be 40 hours per week, in the absence of other indicators.(3) A third factor which would be considered for unionized occupations would be the provisions of any applicable collective bargaining agreements. Such agreements might specify what is considered to be the regular or standard workweek for various classes of workers.In the event that consideration of the above factors results in a finding of different standards for the same occupation in a labor market area, the higher number of hours will be considered the full-time workweek. On the other hand, if no standard can be identified after examining all pertinent factors, 40 hours will be presumed to constitute a week of full-time work.EXAMPLE DIn occupation D, the majority of workers are employed year-round for 20 hours per week. Industrial Welfare Commission Orders pertaining to this occupation require overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week. There is no collective bargaining agreement pertaining to this occupation in the labor market area. Full-time work would be 40 hours per week since that is the higher of the two different standards.EXAMPLE EIn occupation E, the hours worked by each individual varies considerably throughout the year, ranging from 8 to 60 hours per week, depending on conditions affecting the industry. There are no laws or regulations requiring overtime pay for individuals in this occupation, and they are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Since no standard workweek can be identified, 40 hours will be considered to be full-time work.b. Commission Salespersons",
    "What factors are considered in determining what constitutes full-time work in an occupation?"
  ],
  [
    "The above general principles do not apply to some individuals employed as commission salespersons. If a claimant's normal pattern of earning a living is to perform services (i.e., employer-employee relationship) as a commission salesperson, he/she would be considered to be working full time in any week in which he/she performs services in this occupation, regardless of the actual number of hours worked each week. This policy is based on the Appeals Board's findings in P-B-201.In P-B-201, the Board considered the case of a claimant who normally worked full time as a garment cutter and who also was employed in his spare time as a real estate salesman working for commissions. During a seasonal layoff from his work in the garment industry, he worked up to five hours per day as a real estate salesperson but his hours and days of work, as well as his earnings, were irregular. When he filed his claim for benefits during the seasonal layoff from his regular occupation, he was denied benefits under Section 1252 on the grounds that he was fully employed because he could work as many or as few hours as he wished. In holding that the claimant was \"unemployed\" within the meaning of Section 1252, the Board said:\"If an individual normally makes his living in one occupational field such as the garment industry and merely supplements his income by spare time efforts as a commission salesman . . . it is our opinion that he is 'unemployed' when he is temporarily laid off from his work in his usual full-time occupation even though he continues to devote some of his time to his usual spare-time work. His primary occupation is his normal full-time work, and it is the loss of this work and the desire to obtain more of such or similar work which causes him to claim unemployment benefits;On the other hand, if the individual's normal pattern of earning a living is to devote his entire working time each week to work as an employee commission salesman, he is fully employed without regard to his 'wages' whether during a particular week he works 80 hours or 20 hours . . .",
    "Under what circumstances would a commission salesperson be considered unemployed when applying for benefits?"
  ],
  [
    "\"If an individual, during a period of unemployment becomes an employee commission salesman, in an attempt to secure some funds until he is able to obtain work in his usual occupational field which is other than commission sales, it is our opinion that whether he is or is not 'unemployed' depends not so much on whether he devotes 20 hours or 80 hours in this field of fluctuating hours and income but on whether he may realistically be considered as still 'unemployed' insofar as his usual occupational field is concerned or be considered as having changed his normal work pattern to the new occupational field of commission sales. Because of the myriad variations in patterns of employment, each situation must be considered separately to determine as a practical matter what is the claimant's primary occupation; has he remained unemployed so far as that or similar occupations are concerned, or has he obtained temporary or permanent substitute work with which he fills all of his normal working hours considering the nature of the work.\"### C. WagesAnother area to be examined in determining a claimant's eligibility for benefits under Sections 1252 and 1279 is whether he/she has \"wages\" payable with respect to a week of benefits claimed.1. Wages Defined\nBoth Sections 1252 and 1279 contain the following definition:\"For the purpose of this section only 'wages' includes any and all compensation for personal services whether performed as an employee or as an independent contractor or as a juror or as a witness . . .\"It should be noted that this definition of wages includes earnings from work as an independent contractor (self-employment) and from services as a juror or witness even though the amount of time devoted to such work or services does not affect the claimant's eligibility under Section 1252.The UI Code also provides that certain types of payments for personal services are not considered wages within the meaning of Sections 1252 or 1279. Some examples are:. . . any payment received by a member of the National Guard or reserve component of the armed forces for inactive duty training, annual training, or emergency State active duty. (Sections 1252 and 1279). . . payments to an individual under a plan or system, established by an employer which makes provisions for his employees generally or for a class or group of employees, for the purpose of supplementing unemployment insurance benefits (Section 1265)",
    "What factors should be considered to determine if an individual remains 'unemployed' when they take a temporary job as a commission salesman while seeking work in their usual occupational field?"
  ],
  [
    ". . . payments to an individual for vacation pay . . . which was earned but not paid for services performed prior to termination of employment . . . (Section 1265.5)(Discussions about the various types of payments claimants may receive are included in the other categories of this Division of the BDG.)\n2. Allocation of Wages\nFor the purposes of determining eligibility under Sections 1252 and 1279, wages are generally allocated (i.e., considered earned) during the period(s) of time during which the claimant performed the services to which the wages pertain. The date the worker is paid for the services performed is usually immaterial. For example, if a claimant works on Monday, June 18 and receives payment for that work on July 2, the wages would be allocated to the week ending June 23. In applying this general rule it should be kept in mind that services can include or consist of periods of inactive duty. Thus, if an individual earns wages for being on standby status as an employee on Friday, June 22, for which she receives payment on July 2, the wages would be allocated to the week ending June 23.There are several types of payment which are not allocated in accordance with this general rule. Some examples are residual payments and holiday pay that is not paid until the individual returns to work. (To locate discussions concerning the allocation of specific types of wages, see TPU 460.)It should be noted that the general method for allocating wage to determine eligibility under Sections 1252 and 1279 is different from the method used to establish claim validity and to determine the WBA and MBA of a valid claim. The reason for this difference is the different terminology used in the pertinent sections of the UI Code. Section 1252 speaks of \"wages payable . . . with respect to a week\" and 1279 reads \"wages payable to him or her for services rendered during the week.\" In contrast, Section 1275 provides, \"Unemployment compensation benefit award computations shall be based on wages paid in the base period.\"",
    "What is the general rule for allocating wages to determine eligibility under Sections 1252 and 1279, and how does it differ from the method used to establish claim validity?"
  ],
  [
    "Therefore, in the examples given above, wherein the wages were allocated to the week ending June 23 for 1252 and 1279 purposes, these same wages would be allocated to the July-September quarter for claim computation purposes (for further inform concerning benefit computation factors, see MS 60).\n3. Amount of Wages\nAlthough a claimant is required to report to the Department to total gross wages payable, only a portion of those wages affects the claimant's eligibility for benefits under Sections 1252 and 1279.If the wages allocated to a week claimed are $25.99 or less, such earnings are disregarded and, hence, have no effect on the claimant's eligibility for benefits. If the wages are between. $26 and $99. 99, $25 of the wages are disregarded and the amount remaining is considered to be deductible. If the wages are $100 or more, 25 percent of the wages are disregarded and, therefore, the deductible earnings would be 75 percent of the total wages.When the deductible earnings equal or exceed the claimant's WBA, he/she is ineligible for benefits under Section 1252 since he/she does not meet the definition of an unemployed individual. When the deductible earnings are less than the claimant's WBA and the claimant has worked less than full-time, he/she would be ineligible for full weekly benefits under Section 1279. If otherwise eligible, the claimant would be paid the difference between his/her WBA and the deductible earnings.EXAMPLE FClaimant F worked less than full time and earned gross wages of $85 during the week ending August 4. F's WBA is $55. The amount of deductible earnings is $60 ($85 minus $25) which exceeds the claimant's WBA. Therefore, F is ineligible for benefits under Section 1252.EXAMPLE GClaimant G worked less than full time and earned gross wages of $120 during the week ending August 11. G's WBA is $85. The amount of deductible earning is $90 ($120 minus 25% of $120) which exceeds the WBA. Therefore G is ineligible for benefits under Section 1252.EXAMPLE H",

    "# Total and Partial Unemployment TPU 460.85## Welfare Payments### A. WorkforceWelfare recipients are sometimes required to work for their payments. Such work is generally aimed at maintaining the individual\u2019s work habits and the amount of payment is based on the need of the recipient rather than on the amount of work done. Although the claimant may be assigned specific days and hours to work, as a rule this will be less than full-time ant the claimant would be excused to accept regular employment or to participate in job interviews. The claimant, in such instance, is not employed by the Welfare Agency and the payments received, whether in the form of money, credit or goods, are not wages.Example:In *Ghent v. CUIAB*, 1986, the California Court of Appeal addressed \"Workfare\" as wages for the purpose of purging a disqualification under UI Code Section 1256.The claimant quit his job without good cause and moved to Humboldt County. He was disqualified from benefits under Section 1256, and had to earn $380 or more in bona fide employment after a specified date to purge the disqualification. The court summarized his history:\"Thereafter, Ghent applied for, and was granted, general relief assistance by the County. As a condition for receiving this aid, he was required to, and did, perform work assigned by the County. Ghent's monthly relief was $199, and his assigned work each month was credited against his grant at the hourly rate of $3.35. If Ghent had not performed the assigned services, he would not have received the aid. Ghent received one-half of his monthly aid at the beginning of the month, and the balance at the end, after his services were completed.\"Two months after starting work, the claimant asked the Department to purge his prior disqualification because he had then received over $380 in relief from the county. The department denied the purge on the basis that the work which he had performed did not constitute \"bona fide employment.\" In affirming the department, the ALJ, and the Board, the appellate court stated:",
    "What was the basis for the California Court of Appeal's decision in *Ghent v. CUIAB* regarding the classification of work performed by a welfare recipient as \"bona fide employment\"?"
  ],
  [
    "\"The issue on appeal is whether such work performed by Ghent as a condition of receiving general relief under a County-operated work relief program constituted 'bona fide employment' . . . If so, the amount of Ghent's grant constituted 'remuneration' under Section 1260, which purges a disqualification . . . . Work relief is not employment under the Unemployment Insurance Code.Under . . . the Rules and Regulations Governing General Relief Program for Humboldt County, all recipients must reimburse the County for aid given in cash 'subject to any credits for work performed on a work-for-relief project'. . . . In addition to the recipient\u2019s obligation to repay County aid, a consideration of other relevant facts leads inescapably to the conclusion that no contract of hire existed between the County ant Ghent, and that Ghent did not perform services for \"wages\" As . . . County correctly observes: 'Claimant was not put to work through the same processes as are required for regular County employees. He made no contact with personnel; he filled out no application for a particular position; he was not screened by the Department head . . . no pay scale was established, nor were the jobs funded. . . . His aid grant was measured by his need, not by the type of work he did'.\"The Court also commented that the county could not hire or fire their workfare participants \". . . in the traditional meaning of those terms.\" The claimant\u2019s case was built upon case law from Workers' Compensation, which has held that\". . . (an indigent person) is an employee within the meaning of the Workers' Compensation Act.\" In denying a similarity between Workers' Compensation and unemployment insurance, the court found:",
    "What factors did the court consider in determining whether Ghent's participation in the County-operated work relief program constituted 'bona fide employment'?"
  ],
  [
    "\"This definition of employment should NOT be extended to claims arising outside the Workers' Compensation Act. . . Public policy encourages participation in work relief as a way of transferring employable persons from the welfare dole to the employment role . . . If, on the other hand, remaining on work relief were to purge unemployment insurance benefit disqualifications, an undesirable effect would result: able-bodies workers would be encourages to hop from county-to-county, munch from one public treasury to another and thereby multiply the ranks of the unemployment. . . . We hold that Ghent's participation in the County\u2019s work relief program and receipt of aid therefrom did not establish either a statutory or common law employment relationship between County and Ghent. Since workfare is not employment, it does not satisfy the requirement of 'bona fide employment' . . . necessary to purge . . . a disqualification resulting from voluntary unemployment without good cause.\"Finally, the court held that:\"Ghent's participation in the County\u2019s work relief program and receipt of aid therefrom did not establish either a statutory or common law employment relationship between the County and Ghent.\"### B. Foster Parent CompensationUnder the provisions of Sections 11250 and 11251 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, aid and services to a child under foster care are provided when the child is deprived of parental support and care. Aid is defined as financial assistance to or on behalf of needy persons.Since payments to foster parents for the care of foster children are paid on behalf of the child, they do not constitute remuneration for personal services rendered by the foster parent. Therefore, such payments are not wages for UI purposes.",

    "# Total and Partial Unemployment TPU 460.75## Vacation Pay, Sick Pay, Holiday PayThere are potentially two major questions to be resolved on the issue of vacation pay:1. Are the vacation payments wages? If so -\n2. To what period should the vacation payments be allocated?If it is determined that the vacation payments are not wages, then the question of allocation of the vacation payments is, of course, immaterial.### A. Vacation Pay as WagesSection 1265.5 of the Code provides as follows:\"Notwithstanding any other provision of this division payments to an individual for vacation pay which was earned but not paid for services performed prior to termination of employment, shall not be construed to be wages or compensation for personal services under this division and benefits payable under this division shall not be denied or reduced because of the receipt of such payment.\"Vacation payments may or may not be considered wages for UI purposes, depending on whether the payments are made as a result of a \"termination of employment\" as used in Code Section 1265.5.When an individual ceases work for the purpose of taking a vacation and is due back at work on a specific date following the vacation, no termination has occurred.When an individual receives vacation pay because of a quit or discharge which clearly terminates the employment relationship, the payment is not wages.When vacation pay is made as a result of a layoff, it must be determined whether there has been a termination of employment i.e. a break in the employment relationship.1. Fixed Layoff\nA fixed layoff with a specific recall date normally will not break the employment relationship, and no termination of employment occurs.Vacation payments resulting from a fixed layoff, whether in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement, employer policy, or at the claimant's request, will constitute wages under Section 1279.",
    "What criteria determine whether vacation payments are classified as wages under California's unemployment insurance code?"
  ],
  [
    "For example, in Precedent Benefit Decision 161, the employer found it necessary to shut down production operations and place certain of its production workers on a fixed four week layoff. Their terms of the collective bargaining agreement permitted the employer to require such workers to take at least two weeks of their vacation at that time unless they had made arrangements with the employer to defer their vacation to some other time. Since the claimant had made no such arrangement he was paid vacation pay during the first two weeks of the shutdown, and the employer continued in effect his medical and life insurance retirement plan, seniority, etc., for the entire period. In holding that the payments were wages, the Board said:\"Under these facts we hold there was no \"termination of employment\" within the meaning of Section 1265.5 of the Code. Therefore, the payment made to the claimant constituted wages . . .\"The primary factor to be clarified in determining whether an employment relationship has been broken is whether the layoff is for a fixed or indefinite period.\n2. Indefinite Layoff\nThe question of when the termination of the employment relationship occurs has been considered by the courts and by the Board. The California Court of Appeals considered this question in *Campos et al. vs. California Employment Development Department et al.* (183 Cal Rptr. 637 1982)In this case, the claimants were seasonal employees who worked for a frozen food processor. The employer laid the seasonal employees off at the end of the season. At the time they were laid off, the employer did not give them a specific return to work date. The year-round employees continued to work. The laid-off employees filed claims for unemployment insurance benefits and were paid on the claims.The claimants were members of the Teamsters union and were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, those members with most seniority were the last to be laid off and the first to be recalledOn August 26, the union called a strike in a trade dispute connected with contract negotiations. The year-round employees who were working for the employer walked out and the union set up picket lines. Shortly after the strike began, the employer contacted the laid-off seasonal employees and recalled them to work.",
    "What factors were considered by the Board in determining whether the payment made to the claimant constituted wages during the layoff period?"
  ],
  [
    "The seasonal employees declined to return to work since the jobs were open because of a trade dispute. The employer notified the Department that these individuals had refused an offer of work. The Department determined that since the individuals were seasonal employees who had a history of working for the employer and since they were on a \"temporary\" layoff and expected to be recalled at the beginning of the new season, the employees were still attached to the employer and there was no termination of the employment relationship. The Department denied benefits to the claimants under the provisions of Section 1262 since it held they were honoring the picket line.The claimants appealed. The Department's decision was affirmed by an Administrative Law Judge and by the Board. The claimants filed a writ of mandamus. The trial court affirmed the denial of benefits and the claimants appealed that decision. The Court of Appeals in its decision noted that at the time the employer laid off the claimants, the employer did not give the employees a specific date on which to return to work. The court stated: 'It is undisputed here that appellants had been indefinitely laid off in that there was no definite date of recall; . . . .\"The employer and the Board argued that seasonal layoffs were temporary in nature rather than indefinite and that the offer of recall by the employer should therefore not be viewed as \"new work \"The court said '. . . where the employees have no contractual right to recall within any specified time period, the better approach is to treat such layoffs as indefinite, . . . .'The court held that the offer of recall was an offer of new work and that the claimants had good cause to refuse the offer under the provisions of Section 1259 of the UI Code since the positions offered were vacant because of a labor dispute.In Precedent Benefit Decision, P-B-430, the Board considered the question of when the termination of the employment relationship occurs. The claimant in this case was an intermittent employee of the Employment Development Department. The claimant worked last on November 25, 1981. She was laid off on that date as she had worked 1500 hours in the year and could not work any additional hours in that calendar year. At the time of the layoff the claimant was not scheduled to report to work on a specific date following January 1, 1982.",
    "What was the reasoning behind the court's decision to classify the employees' layoffs as indefinite rather than temporary?"
  ],
  [
    "The claimant filed a claim for benefits. At the time of her layoff the claimant requested three weeks vacation pay which the Department granted. The Department held that the claimant was only temporarily laid off as she was eligible for recall to work effective January 1 of the new year. The Department contended there had been no termination of the employment relationship within the meaning of Section 1265.5 of the UI Code since both the claimant and the Department anticipated that she would return to work in the new year. The Department allocated the vacation pay to the weeks for which the claimant requested the pay and the claimant was ineligible for benefits for those weeks.The Department cited Precedent Benefit Decision, P-B-161 in support of its position that a temporary layoff is not a termination of employment within the meaning of Section 1265.5.The Board rejected that argument and stated: \"In the present case, unlike the situations in Appeals Board Decision Nos. P-B-161 and P-B-410 the claimant was given no definite date of recall following her layoff. The fact that she may have been placed on recall status is by itself of no consequence (Appeals Board Decision No. P-B-92) . . . . It is clear that the claimant was laid off for an indefinite period of time. Consequently, her employment was terminated within the meaning of Section 1265.5 of the Code and her vacation pay does not constitute wages.\"It is clear from these two cases cited above that when an employer lays off an employee and does not give the employee a definite date on which to report to work, the layoff is for an indefinite Period and there is a termination of the employment relationship within the meaning of Section 1265.5 of the UI Code.Partial ClaimsThese principles would apply to Partial Claims also. The fact that an employer has issued a \"Partial Card\" to laid-off employees does not mean the employees are on a definite layoff. If, at the time of the layoff, the employer did not give the employees a definite date on which to return to work, the layoff is an indefinite layoff.PMA Partial Cards",
    "What did the Board conclude regarding the claimant's employment status following her layoff?"
  ],
  [
    "The above does not apply, however to claimants who are issued \"Partial Cards\" by the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA). The claimants are member of the Longshoremen's union. The collective bargaining agreement provides for worksharing rotational hiring procedures to ensure that each worker receives an equal number of assignments. The courts have held that union members who work under the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement have a continuing employment relationship with the employer. (*Matson Terminals, Inc. vs. California Employment Commission (1944) Supreme Court*, 151 p.2d 202; *Barber and Crouse vs. California Employment Stabilization Commission* (1954 130 Cal. App. 2d 7)The court in Matson stated that where the employee \"has a legally enforceable right whereby the group is entitled to first call on the work and each longshoreman is entitled to his share . . . . The longshore work that each claimant regularly performed for the various member of the employers' association and to which he had an exclusive right {,} was 'his work' within the meaning of {former Section 56(a); currently Section 1262}.\"Conditional Return to Work DateOn occasion, an employer may lay off employees and advise them at the time of the layoff to report to the company on a specified date to see if there is work to be performed. This is not a guarantee of work. The employer has not given the employees a definite date on which to return to work therefore, the layoff is considered to be for an indefinite period. Any vacation pay which is paid during such a period of layoff is not wages for unemployment insurance purposes.\n3. Vacation Pay During Trade Dispute\nIn P-B-451, the claimant was locked out, due to a trade dispute, on June 1, 1985. Prior to the lockout, the claimant scheduled his vacation for the first two weeks in July. The employer required that the employees schedule their vacations at year's end and they could not thereafter be cancelled.The claimant was subsequently paid the vacation wages during the vacation period. In deciding that the vacation pay was wages, the Board said:\"In *Mark Hopkins, Inc. vs. California Employment Commission* . . . , the court held that a strike does not terminate an employment relationship, it simply suspends it.As in Mark Hopkins, the situation before us involves unemployment resulting from a trade dispute.",
    "What key provisions are established by the collective bargaining agreement for longshoremen represented by the Pacific Maritime Association?"
  ],
  [
    "Although the claimant ceased performing services on or about June 1, 1985, that event was brought about by neither a voluntary leaving of work, a discharge, a lack of work, or anything other than a dispute regarding the terms and conditions of employment. Neither party had taken any affirmative action to sever the employment relationship. In fact, that relationship continued beyond the claimant's last day of work as evidenced by his receiving a wage payment in accordance with his scheduled vacation.Since there was no termination, such payment constitutes wages and must reduce the claimant's benefit entitlement in accordance with Unemployment Insurance Code Section 1252.\"Accordingly, vacation pay received by individuals who are still attached to the employer during the trade dispute and are expected to return to work at the end of the dispute is considered wages. This would include claimants who have taken strike action or have been locked out and claimants who have honored picket lines.Claimants who are laid off prior to or during a trade dispute, without a fixed return-to-work date at the time of layoff, are considered to be on an indefinite layoff. An indefinite layoff severs the employer-employee relationship. Consequently, vacation pay received by such claimants during the trade dispute is not considered wages.During the course of the trade dispute the claimant's employer-employee relationship may be changed by other actions, such as: voluntary quit, discharge, permanent replacement, plant closure, etc. If the change severs the employer-employee relationship, any vacation pay paid after severance is not considered wages even though the trade dispute continues.\n4. Vacation Pay - Hourly Payments\nLabor organizations, particularly those in the construction trades, commonly have contract provisions which specify a certain amount of \"vacation pay\" for each hour worked. The following examples illustrate how vacation payments are handled under the three most common types of bargaining agreements.Example AThe worker's hourly wage is $7. Of this, the employer holds back twenty-five cents an hour which is deposited to the worker's credit in a vacation trust fund. In this case the \"vacation pay\" is wages allocable to the period earned. Consequently, part-total earnings must be reported at the worker's gross pay rate of $7 per hour.However, later receipt of the accumulated funds from the vacation trust fund raises no wages issue, as the worker is merely taking delayed delivery of a portion of his prior wages.Example B",
    "What happens to vacation pay received by an employee who is still attached to the employer during a trade dispute?"
  ],
  [
    "The worker's hourly wage is $6.50. Because the worker will take no \"paid vacation\" in the traditional sense, the employer augments this wage by fifty cents and pays him $7 per hour to compensate for the lack of an actual vacation. Unlike the above example, that portion of his pay labeled as \"vacation pay\" is not held back but is paid to the worker at that timeConsequently, the payment is wages allocable to the period earned. In the event of a \"termination\", the mere labeling of a part of the pay as \"vacation\" does not bring it within the provisions of Section 1265.5.Example CThe worker's hourly wage is $10.50. The collective bargaining agreement requires the employer to contribute specified amounts for various fringe benefits. For example, the agreement may specify that the employer will contribute $0.75 for each hour worked into the vacation fund; $1 per hour for medical and life insurance, etc.The vacation pay is deposited in a trust fund administered by the union. The collective bargaining agreement provides that the members will not take vacation time off and that the union will pay the members any accumulated vacation pay once a year by a specified date.The employer contributions into the vacation fund do constitute wages. The California Supreme Court stated in *Suastez vs. Plastic Dress-up Co.* \"It is established that vacation pay is not a gratuity or a gift, but is, in effect, additional wages for services performed.\" The Court stated that many other courts had taken the view that vacation pay is an alternate form of wages which are earned at the time of other wages but whose receipt is delayed.Should the payment of the vacation pay coincide with a period in which the claimant is on a definite layoff, the vacation pay is wages but would be allocable to the period when earned. Since the claimant cannot take vacation time off, the vacation pay would be allocated to the period when the individual earned the vacation not to the period of the layoff.In this example, the claimant's gross hourly wages while performing services are $11.25, not $10.50. This figure is arrived at by adding the hourly wage, $10.50, to the hourly vacation contributions, $0.75, required by the collective bargaining agreement.",
    "What is the total gross hourly wage for a worker whose base wage is $10.50 and who receives an additional $0.75 per hour for vacation contributions under a collective bargaining agreement?"
  ],
  [
    "The employer contributions for medical and life insurance are not wages for unemployment insurance purposes as provided in Section 931 of the UI Code. This section provides, in part, as follows:\"'Wages' does not include the amount of any payment, including any amount paid by an employer for insurance or annuities, or into a fund, to provide for any payment, made to or on behalf of an employee . . . under a plan or system established by an employer which makes provision for his or her employees generally . . . on account of any of the following:(a) Sickness or accident disability . . .(b) Medical or hospitalization expenses in connection with sickness or accident disability.(c) Death.\"Therefore, the contributions made by the employer for health and welfare benefits such as medical, dental, vision and life insurance, etc., are not wages for unemployment insurance purposes and cannot be used to establish a claim, clear a lag, purge a disqualification, etc.The contributions into the vacation fund, as stated above, are wages for unemployment insurance purposes and can be used to establish a claim, clear a lag, purge a disqualification, etc.\n5. \"Pro Rata Vacation Pay\"\nThis type of vacation pay is paid for a portion of a full vacation period. It is generally paid to an individual who is terminated or laid off through no fault of his/her own and who would have otherwise qualified for annual vacation pay had he/she remained in employment.For example, an employer-employee agreement provides that all employees who have worked for one full year shall receive two weeks annual vacation pay. Generally, such an agreement also provides that an employee who only works half of a year and is terminated through no fault of his/her own shall receive one week vacation pay. Because this pay is for a portion of the year, it is called \"pro rata\" vacation pay.It should be noted that where pro rata vacation pay is paid upon termination. it would not be considered wages.\n6. Vacation Pay - State Intermittent Employees\nSee discussion of P-B-430 in item 2 above. When a State intermittent employee is laid off due to budgetary considerations and does not have a definite date of recall, the employee shall be considered to be on an indefinite layoff and terminated for purpose of Section 1265.5, even though the employee has not been terminated from State service. Accordingly, vacation pay requested during such periods of layoff shall not be considered wages.",
    "What types of employer contributions are not considered wages for unemployment insurance purposes, according to Section 931 of the UI Code?"
  ],
  [
    "The above principle applies whenever there is an indefinite layoff as described above, irrespective of whether the intermittent employee has reached the 1500-hour limitation.### B. Allocation of Vacation PayOnce it is determined that the vacation pay at issue is wages, then the question of the allocation of the vacation pay must be resolved. The question of allocation is immaterial if the vacation pay is not considered wages.1. Authority to Allocate Vacation Pay\nThe Department has the final authority to determine the proper allocation of vacation pay after consideration of all the information obtained. This was the Board's findings in P-B-40. This was a 1967 case involving a claimant who received pro rata vacation pay upon termination. (In 1967, the UI Code provided that all vacation payments were considered wages, whether or not the employee was terminated.) Section 19 of the collective bargaining agreement spelled out the conditions under which an employee became eligible for vacation pay. Included in Section 19 was the following provision:(3) For purposes of this Section 19, all pro rata vacation pay shall be allocated to the period worked and not the period when Paid.This provision was specifically included in the contract because union members who receive pro rata vacation pay could not immediately receive unemployment insurance benefits upon layoff. In rejecting the allocation provided in the contract, the Board said:\"When an individual, in receipt of vacation pay from a former employer files a claim for unemployment benefits, the Department of Employment is obligated to designate the period to which the vacation is to be allocated. This is true because it is the statutory duty of the Department of Employment to determine a claimant's eligibility for benefits (see Section 1328 of the Unemployment Insurance Code).",
    "What role does the Department of Employment play in determining the allocation of vacation pay for individuals filing for unemployment benefits?"
  ],
  [
    "The State Legislature has seen fit to permit the Director of Employment to delegate certain of his responsibilities; for example, in Subsection (b) of Section 1253 of the Code, the Director of Employment may approve places other than a public employment office as a place where an unemployed individual may register for work. The legislature has not permitted the Department of Employment to delegate its authority to determine a claimant's eligibility for benefits. Therefore, we conclude that regardless of the desires of an employer or the terms of a union contract, when an unemployed individual files a claim for unemployment benefits, the Department of Employment must determine the individual's eligibility for benefits and if such individual is in receipt of vacation pay or pro rata vacation pay at the time the claim is filed the Department of Employment is the only agency which may allocate such payments.\"The Board went on to conclude that since other sections of the contract provided that the pro rata vacation pay was earned in a prior period and was realizable only upon termination, the only logical and reasonable allocation of such pay was to the period following termination.\n2. General Rule for Allocation of Vacation Pay\nWhile the Department has the final authority to decide on the allocation of vacation pay the Appeals Board, in PD 160 has recognized that:\"As a general rule, the employer has the inherent authority to designate a vacation period for its employees and to allocate any vacation payment. This right may be limited by a collective bargaining agreement, in which case, generally the allocation must be in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Vacation payments will be allocated to the extent possible to the period when a vacation actually is taken.\"\n3. Employer Authority on Allocation\nAs indicated above, subject to the limitations under a collective bargaining agreement, the employer has the inherent authority to designate vacation periods for its employees. This is evidenced by contract language such as the following:Vacation requests must be submitted to the employee's supervisor at least three weeks in advance for approval. Final approval rests with the Managing Director.Vacations are to be scheduled so as to cause the least inconvenience in a department and at times approved by the department foreman.Vacations are to be scheduled consistent with the efficient operations of the employer's business.If production schedules require, all vacations within a given department can be rescheduled by the employer.",
    "What authority does the employer have regarding the allocation of vacation pay, and how may this authority be affected by a collective bargaining agreement?"
  ],
  [
    "In BD 5521, the collective bargaining agreement provided that vacations are taken, with management's approval, between April 1 to December 31 of each year. On January 23, 1947, the employer posted a notice for its employees stating there would be a two-week plant shutdown period between August 16, 1947, and September 2, 1947, and that it expected its employees to take their vacations at this time. On May 14, 1947, the employer again posted a notice providing this same information. In addition, the notice indicated that employees could request permission from their foreman to take time off at some other time. On August 15, 1947, immediately prior to the shutdown, the claimant was issued a week's vacation pay. He refused to accept it as he wanted to take a week's vacation during the deer hunting season in October. He had not previously made such a request. In holding the vacation pay was allocable to the week ending August 23, 1947, and denying benefits for this period, the Board said:\"Although the agreement gave an option to employees to select their vacation time, with the management's approval, between a prescribed period, we cannot find in its terms where the employer contracted away its prerogative, which we believe was inherent in it, to allow vacations to its employees at a time of its own choosing, should it wish to exercise the right. In exercising the right in the instant case, the employer did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in designating a vacation period for its employees. Ample notice was given to its employees, including the claimant, that the shut down period necessitated by an electric power changeover, over which the employer had no control, would be the vacation period for them. The employees who were not satisfied with this designation could use the grievance procedure set up between the employer and employees whereby an adjustment as to vacation period could be sought and adjudicated. A number of employees used this procedure and some were successful in obtaining the desired adjustment. The claimant herein did not seek to have an adjustment made in his particular case.",
    "What was the basis for the employer's decision to designate the shutdown period from August 16 to September 2, 1947, as the vacation period for its employees?"
  ],
  [
    "We conclude on all of the facts herein that the tender of vacation pay to the claimant by the employer was tantamount to a payment thereof to him and was in an amount greater than that to which he would have been entitled as unemployment insurance benefits; therefore, he was not 'unemployed' during the calendar week August 17 through August 23, 1947, when he was in receipt of such payment.\"In BD 5571, the collective bargaining agreement provided that preference on vacation dates would be given according to seniority \". . . as reasonably as possible.\" Early in the year, the claimant had arranged to take two weeks vacation in July and actually did go to a resort area during this period. However, beginning June 15, 1949, the claimant left his work, due to a trade dispute, involving his union and remained on strike until October 2, 1949, when the TD ended. The employer considered vacations suspended during the TD and did not issue vacation checks during this period. When the TD ended, the claimant was temporarily laid off and thereupon filed a claim for benefits. At the time of the layoff, the claimant was paid two weeks vacation pay which the employer considered allocable to the period October 3, 1949, through October 14, 1949. In sustaining the employer's position, the Board said:\"Under the contract in effect between the claimant's union and the employer, it appears clear that it was within the province of the employer to specify the period of vacation subject to the provisions of the contract regarding seniority. Although the claimant in this case, prior to the commencement of the trade dispute, had tentatively arranged for his vacation during the last two weeks of July, it is our conclusion that this tentative agreement was not binding on the employer, as the employer, having the basic right to set the period of vacation in the first place, had the right to change such period under altered circumstance.\"",
    "What was the reason the employer did not issue vacation checks during the trade dispute period?"
  ],
  [
    "On the other hand, it should be noted that where the facts indicate the employer's allocation is arbitrary, the Board has not supported the employer's position. In BD 6263, the collective bargaining agreement provided that vacation periods extended from May to November of each year and the employer had the right to specify when vacations would be given. The employer designated a certain week in July and another in October as the vacation weeks. The claimant took the scheduled week in July and, by arrangement with the employer, took his second week in August. In deciding the issue of allocation, the Board said:\". . . the claimant was given one weeks vacation in August and the employer paid him at that time. In our opinion, this action can only be construed as allocating the vacation pay to that week. As the employer has already allocated the vacation pay due the claimant to a period in August, we find that the employer cannot now reallocate this pay to a period in October.\"\n4. Collective Bargaining Agreement\nWhere there is a collective bargaining agreement covering the payment of vacation pay, the allocation should normally be in accord with its provisions. A collective bargaining agreement will normally contain the specific time parameters during which an employee may request and be granted vacation time off. In BD 6658, the claimant was laid off due to lack of work on May 5, 1961, and paid vacation pay for the vacation year which ended April 30, 1961.The claimant contended the vacation pay should be allocated to May and June of 1960, when he took a three-week vacation without pay. The Board held that:\"The union agreement provides that an employee cannot take a vacation with respect to any vacation year until after the computation date. Since the computation date of the vacation year, April 24, 1960, to April 30, 1961, was April 30, 1961, the (vacation) check can not be allocated to May and June 1960.\"",

    "The Board then concluded the vacation payment was allocable to the two-week period following termination. (At this time, the UI Code provided that vacation pay paid after termination was considered wages.)\n5. Allocation to Period Vacation Actually Taken\nWhile bearing in mind the employer's authority to designate vacation periods and the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement governing scheduling of vacations, to the extent possible, vacation payments should be allocated to the period the vacation is actually taken or scheduled to be taken. It is only reasonable that vacation pay, i.e., \"pay\" for a \"vacation\" be applied to an actual vacation from employment.In PD 160, which involved a DI claim, the claimant was disabled and filed for DI from April 13, 1973, through August 12, 1973, when he returned to work. Thereafter, he went on his scheduled four-week vacation beginning September 3, 1973. On June 10, 1973, the employer made vacation payments to all its employees and, consequently, the Department allocated the payments to the period beginning June 10, 1973. In allocating the vacation payments to the period the vacation was actually taken in September, instead of the date the payments were made, the Board said:\". . . although the claimant was paid the vacation pay on June 10, 1973, while he was off work because disabled, his vacation had then been scheduled to begin September 3, 1973, and in fact, the claimant did begin his vacation as scheduled. We do not consider the mere fact that the claimant was paid on June 10, 1973, determinative of the allocation issue when all other employees were paid their vacation pay at the same time without regard to their vacation schedules. In our opinion the referee correctly allocated the vacation pay for the four weeks to the period when the claimant actually began his previously scheduled four-week vacation.\"It should be noted that, in the above case, the claimant's September vacation was taken with the employer's permission and was in accord with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement governing the scheduling of vacation periods.\n6. Vacation Payment Made, No Scheduled Vacation to Date\nAs previously stated, to the extent possible, vacation payments should be allocated to the period the vacation is actually taken. However, in some cases, at the time vacation payments are made, a claimant may not have arranged a scheduled vacation as yet. Under these circumstances, to what period should the allocation be made?",
    "What criteria does the Board use to determine the allocation of vacation payments in relation to the actual period when the vacation is taken?"

    "In BD 6756, the claimant was laid off due to lack of work in April 1964 and was thereafter unemployed for 10 weeks, and was recalled to work on July 6, 1964, at which time he was paid two weeks vacation pay. The claimant filed a claim in April 1964 and the department allocated the vacation payment from June 28 through July 11, 1964. Under the collective bargaining agreement, the claimant could arrange to take a two-week vacation sometime during the 12-month period between July 1, 1964, through June 30, 1965, or could continue to work without taking a vacation, in which case the vacation would be considered a bonus in lieu of vacation. At the time he was paid the vacation payment, the claimant had not yet arranged a scheduled vacation for the next vacation year. In deciding on the allocation of the vacation payment, the Board said:\"There is no evidence that (the claimant) had selected a vacation period, or requested and obtained approval of such leave from his foreman . . .Under these circumstances, we hold that the vacation pay is allocable only to such period or periods as the (claimant) may actually take a vacation; if (the claimant does) not take a vacation, the payments will be considered as a bonus in lieu of vacation.\"HOWEVER, although an individual may not have arranged a vacation period, it is possible that under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, the employer may have the option of designating a specific vacation period for its employees and may have done so. In PB 161, there was a four-week plant shutdown effective July 2, 1973. The employer exercised its option, under the contract, of requiring its employees to take their vacation during this shutdown period, except that the contract also provided that the employees could make a special request to take their vacation at some other time. The Board held that the claimant's vacation pay was allocable to the shutdown period.",
    "What did the Board determine regarding the allocation of vacation pay for the claimant in BD 6756 if he did not request and schedule a vacation period?"
  ],
  [
    "The Board found that the claimant had not made any other arrangements with the employer and that the employer's designation of the shutdown period as the vacation period was fully in accord with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.\n7. Date of Vacation Payment Not Necessarily Controlling in Allocation\nIn PD 160, the employer computed and paid vacation payments to all its employees on June 10, 1973; however, the employees were scheduled to take their vacation periods at various dates during the ensuing 12 months. The claimant in PD 160 took his actual four weeks' vacation, as scheduled, in September 1973. The Board found that the fact the claimant was paid on June 10 was not determinative of the allocation issue. It then allocated the payment to the period the vacation was actually taken in September.### C. Pay In Lieu of VacationThis is a payment for vacation credit earned with no scheduled vacation time off taken. It is, in effect, a bonus for working and not taking a vacation. Accordingly, since it is in the nature of a bonus, it is allocable to the period earned.Example:An employer in a seasonal industry normally operates from March 1 through November 30 of each year. The employees are expected to work continuously during the period the plant is open. The collective bargaining agreement provides that vacation credit is earned based on seniority and the hours worked during the prior calendar year. The employer computes the amount of the vacation pay and on February 1 makes the vacation payment to its employees; however, the contract makes no provisions for the actual taking of a vacation. The payment made is considered to be a pay in lieu of vacation payment.As indicated by the above example, this type of plan may be found in a seasonal industry where the employer has a plant closure of a relatively long duration. In other instances, a pay in lieu of vacation provision may be included in a contract whereby an employee may actually take a vacation for part of the vacation credit earned and take a \"pay in lieu of vacation\" for the remaining period. In some cases, a collective bargaining agreement may give the employer the authority to cancel an employee's planned vacation, usually due to economic conditions, and the employee is then paid his vacation but continues working.Sick PaySection 1265.7 of the Code provides, in pertinent part, as follows:",
    "What does the Board's finding indicate about the employer's designation of the shutdown period as the vacation period in relation to the collective bargaining agreement?"

  [
    "\". . . payments to an individual for sick pay which is earned but not paid for services performed prior to termination of employment, shall not be construed to be wages or compensation for personal services under this division and shall not be denied or reduced because of the receipt of such payments.\"Accordingly, as in vacation pay, the critical factor on whether or not sick pay is wages is whether the claimant has been terminated from employment. \"Termination\" in this context means a leaving of work due to an indefinite layoff, quit, discharge, etc. The same criteria used in vacation, as discussed earlier in this section, applies to sick leave pay in determining whether or not there has been a termination of employment. If there has been a termination of employment then the sick pay would not be considered wages.Holiday Pay1. Applicable Code Section\nSection 1265.6 is the Code section which governs eligibility with respect to holiday payment. It states:\"Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, payments to an individual for holiday pay for any holiday occurring in a week during which the individual was unemployed shall be deemed wages received for the week in which the individual returns to work, if holiday pay is not paid until the individual returns to work from a definite period of layoff. Payments to an individual for holiday pay for any holiday occurring in a week during which the individual was unemployed shall be deemed wages received for the week in which the holiday falls, if holiday pay is paid prior to the individual's return to work from a definite period of layoff. However, payments to an individual for holiday pay which was earned but not paid prior to an indefinite layoff, or termination of employment, or commencement of unemployment caused by disability, as the case may be, shall not be construed to be wages or compensation for personal services under this division and benefits payable under this division shall not be denied or reduced because of the receipt of these payments.\"\n2. Major Considerations in Resolving Holiday Pay Issue\nAs with vacation pay, there are two major considerations when determining how receipt of holiday pay affects benefit eligibility.a. Whether holiday pay is wagesb. Allocation of holiday payments- Whether Holiday Pay is WagesAs with vacation pay, termination from employment is the critical factor which determines whether the holiday pay is considered wages. If there has been a termination of employment then the holiday pay would not be considered wages. The same criteria used in vacation pay applies to holiday pay in determining whether or not there has been a termination of employment.",
