    "For example, in Precedent Benefit Decision 161, the employer found it necessary to shut down production operations and place certain of its production workers on a fixed four week layoff. Their terms of the collective bargaining agreement permitted the employer to require such workers to take at least two weeks of their vacation at that time unless they had made arrangements with the employer to defer their vacation to some other time. Since the claimant had made no such arrangement he was paid vacation pay during the first two weeks of the shutdown, and the employer continued in effect his medical and life insurance retirement plan",
