You can be paid benefits for a maximum of 52 weeks. For more information, review [Calculating Disability Benefit Payment Amounts](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/).\n\nTo receive benefits, you must:\n\n* File a claim for DI benefits using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) or [by mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/).\n* Complete a seven-day, unpaid waiting period.\n* Have earned at least $300 in wages that are subject to SDI deductions (“CASDI” on your paystubs) during the 12-month [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) of your claim.\n* Have your physician/practitioner certify to your disability by completing the Physician/Practitioner Certification.\n* Choose your payment option when you file your claim:\n\t+ Direct Deposit (SDI Online claims only)\n\t+ Debit card\n\t+ Check\n\nTo learn more, review the following:\n\n* [Disability Insurance - Overview](/en/disability/disability_insurance/)\n* [DI Benefits and Payments FAQs](/en/disability/faqs-benefits-payments/)\n* [Disability Insurance Provisions (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de2515.pdf)\n* [Your Benefit Payment Options](/en/about_edd/your-benefit-payment-options/)"

Paper forms still need to be filled out to begin or extend the medical portion of a claim.\n\nTalk to your licensed health professional about their process for submitting a medical certification (not all medical offices follow the same steps or process).\n\n**Note:** Your claim is not complete until your licensed health professional completes a medical certification.\n\nYou can get medical extension forms by contacting us at 1-866-758-9768\\.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\nFor more information about NDI, refer to:\n\n* [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance FAQs](/en/disability/nonindustrial/faqs/)\n* [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance Claim Process](/en/disability/nonindustrial/claim-process/)\n* [Family Care Leave (NDI-FCL) Overview](/en/disability/nonindustrial/family-care-leave/)\n* [CalHR](http://calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/non-industrial-disability-insurance.aspx)"

These are licensed health professionals responsible for the supplemental examinations that verify a disability status by providing a second medical opinion when the original certification is in question. Examinations by the SDI program follow the guidelines listed in [Section 2627(c)-1(b) of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I06F3D3C0D4B711DE8879F88E8B0DAAAE&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29#IC10399C8AA3641A2B98947DD7AC9FD55).\n\nFor example, SDI may request an examination if a licensed health professional lists the claimant’s disability as lasting longer than what is considered normal for the diagnosis but doesn’t provide a medically justified reason.\n\nIndependent medical examinations assist SDI in preserving the Disability Fund for the benefit of workers who are insured through SDI.\n\n### How to Become an Independent Medical Examiner\n\nIf you are a licensed health professional and would like to become an Independent Medical Examiner, contact us by emailing [DIBMedical@edd.ca.gov](mailto:DIBMedical@edd.ca.gov) or at the mailing address below. Please provide us with a contact phone number, email, and mailing address.

Both SDI and VP provide short-term wage replacement disability insurance and family leave benefits.\n\n* [## Getting Started](#pane-3ca178e5-10e0-4380-8233-9fab6f50f9a9)\n* [## Manage Claims](#pane-2150c4e5-033a-45fa-a0c0-3141f36780f8)\n* [## Tax Reporting](#pane-a41661ec-f32f-4439-8a83-09d3704cfeef)\n\n## [Getting Started](#collapse-3ca178e5-10e0-4380-8233-9fab6f50f9a9 \"Getting Started\")\n\nIn order to offer VP, you must first apply and get approval from the EDD. For information on how to apply, visit [Become a Voluntary Plan Employer](/en/disability/Pre-Requisites_for_Becoming_a_Voluntary_Plan_Employer/).\n\nA VP must:\n\n* Offer the same benefits to employees as SDI.\n* Provides at least one benefit that is better than SDI.\n* Not cost employees more than SDI.\n* Be updated to match any increase in benefits that SDI implements from legislation or approved regulation.\n\n## [Manage Claims](#collapse-2150c4e5-033a-45fa-a0c0-3141f36780f8 \"Manage Claims\")\n\nYou can process VP claims conveniently and securely using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) to submit State Award Request (SAR). To set up your online account, visit [Manage Your Voluntary Plan](/en/disability/VP_Online_Services/).\n\n## [Tax Reporting](#collapse-a41661ec-f32f-4439-8a83-09d3704cfeef \"Tax Reporting\")\n\nYou do not need to send in [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/) contributions for employees covered under a Voluntary Plan (VP). But, you must send SDI contributions for employees with SDI coverage. Any contributions that are required from VP employees must be secured in a trust fund. For any employees who opt-out, you (employer) must send their SDI contributions to the EDD Tax Branch. To learn how to file online, visit [Voluntary Plan Tax Reporting](/en/disability/Tax_Reporting_on_VP_Accounts/).\n\n## Contact the Voluntary Plan Group\n\nFor assistance, you can contact the Voluntary Plan Group by phone, email, or mail:\n\n* Email: [VPProgram@edd.ca.gov](mailto:VPProgram@edd.ca.gov)\n* Call 1-916-653-6839 or TTY users, dial the California Relay Service at 711\n* Mail to:  \nEmployment Development Department  \nDisability Insurance Branch  \nVoluntary Plan Group, MIC 29VP  \nPO Box 826880  \nSacramento, CA 94280-0001\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n* [*Employer’s Guide to Voluntary Plan Procedures* (DE 2040\\)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de2040.pdf)\n* [Voluntary Plan FAQs](/en/disability/FAQ_Voluntary_Plans/)\n* [Voluntary Plan Forms and Publications](/en/disability/VP_Forms_and_Publications/)\n* [VP Security Deposit Requirements](/en/disability/VP_Security_Deposit_Requirements/)\n* [VP Claim Eligibility and Requirements](/en/disability/VP_Claim_Eligibility_Requirements/)\n* [Contribution Rates and Benefit Amounts](/en/disability/Contribution_Rates_and_Benefit_Amounts/)\n* [CA Unemployment Insurance Code (CUIC) (Disability Compensation – Voluntary Plan)](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=UIC&division=1.&title=&part=2.&chapter=6.&article)\n* [California Code of Regulations (CCR) (Title 22\\)](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I6F56A7E1D4B611DE8879F88E8B0DAAAE&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default))"
