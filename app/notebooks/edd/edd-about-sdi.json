You can file a claim by mail or even faster with [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).\n\nNote: If any of the following apply, you should file a paper claim form instead of filing online:\n\n* You do not have a valid California driver license or ID.\n* You do not have a valid SSN.\n* You have a name that does not fit the space in the online form.\n* You had a recent name change.\n* You received an error code you cannot resolve or have any other difficulty filing an application online.\n\nFollow these steps to file a Disability Insurance (DI) claim by mail.\n\n## Step 1: Get Your Claim Form\n\nYou can get a paper *Claim for Disability Insurance (DI) Benefits* (DE 2501) form by:\n\n* Ordering a [form online](https://forms.edd.ca.gov/forms) to have it mailed to you.\n* Getting the form from your licensed health professional or employer.\n* Visiting an [SDI Office](https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/Contact_SDI/).\n* Calling 1-800-480-3287 and selecting DI Information option 3 to request a paper form by mail.\n\n**Note**: Allow up to ten days to receive this form.\n\n## Step 2: Gather Required Information\n\nYou **must**provide the following information to file a DI claim:\n\n* First and last name.\n* Most current employer’s business name, phone number, and mailing address (as stated on your W-2 or paystub).\n* Last date you worked your normal or usual duties (or the date you began working less than full or modified duty).\n\nYou must also give the following information **only**if it applies to you:\n\n* Any wages you received or expect to receive from your employer (sick leave, paid time off (PTO), vacation pay, annual leave, and wages earned after you stopped working).\n* Any [workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) claim information.\n* If you receive in-patient treatment at an alcohol recovery home or drug-free rehabilitation facility, provide the name, address, and phone number of the home or facility.\n\nNote: The facility must be licensed and certified by the state in which the facility is located.\n\n## Step 3: Complete Part A: Claimant’s Statement (DE 2501)\n\nYou are responsible for filling out Part A - Claimant’s Statement of the DE 2501 form. Write clearly in the spaces provided. Fill out the form completely using black ink only, and sign the form. An incomplete form could delay processing.\n\n## Step 4: Get Your Licensed Health Professional to Complete Part B: Medical Certification\n\nYou must get a licensed health professional certification for your disability. Once you have filled out Part A of the DE 2501 form, contact your licensed health professional about completing, signing, and submitting your medical certification (Part B – Physician/professional’s Certificate).\n\nTalk to your licensed health professional about their process for submitting a DI claim (not all of them follow the same process). Your licensed health professional must submit the certification no later than 49 days after your disability begins or you may lose benefits.\n\n* If your licensed health professional wants to submit the medical certification using SDI Online, allow 14 calendar days for us to receive and process your claim.\n* After your claim has been received, your licensed health professional can find your claim in [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).\n\n## Step 5: Mail in Your Completed DI Claim Form (DE 2501)\n\nThere are two parts to completing this form. For your claim to be considered complete, both parts of the DE 2501 form need to be submitted:\n\n* Part A - Claimant’s Statement\n* Part B - Physician/professional’s Medical Certificate (a licensed health professional can submit this part)\n\nYou can file your claim on the first day of your disability, but to avoid creating delays on your claim, losing benefits, or having your claim disqualified, you should file your claim:\n\n* No earlier than nine days after your disability begins.\n* No later than 49 days after your disability begins\n\nIf you have a good reason for filing late, please provide that explanation when you file your claim so the claims analyst can review your information to make a determination.\n\nYour claim will not be processed until we receive both part A and part B.\n\nUse the pre-addressed envelope to mail to:\n\nState of California  \nEmployment Development Department  \nPO Box 989777  \nWest Sacramento, CA 95798-9777\n\nDo not submit the same claim more than once. This will delay your claim.\n\n**Note:** Your employer will be notified that you have submitted a DI claim. However, medical information is confidential and will not be shared with your employer.\n\nFor more information on how to file a DI claim using SDI Online, view our [Claimant Tutorials](/en/disability/SDI_Online_Tutorials/) and an outline on the [Disability Insurance Claim Process](/en/disability/DI_Claim_Process/).", "nonaccordion": "If you think you're [eligible for benefits](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_DI_Benefits/), file a claim to apply.

{"url": "https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/About_DI/", "title": "About Disability Insurance", "main_content": "Disability Insurance (DI) is a part of the [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/About_the_State_Disability_Insurance_SDI_Program/) program. It provides partial wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers who are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy. SDI contributions are paid by California workers through employee payroll deductions.\n\nDI does not provide job protection, only monetary benefits; however, your job may be protected through other federal or state laws such as the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) or the [California Family Rights Act (CFRA)](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I6A8A63F05A0A11EC8227000D3A7C4BC3&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)).\n\n## Disability Insurance\n\nDisability is an illness or injury, either physical or mental, which prevents you from performing your regular and customary work. Disability also includes elective surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical conditions.\n\nAlthough work-related disabilities are covered by workers’ compensation laws, DI benefits may also be paid for work-related illness or injuries under certain circumstances. You can learn more about the difference between [workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) and DI.\n\n## Disability Insurance Benefit Payments\n\nIf you are eligible, you can receive about 60 to 70 percent (depending on income) of wages earned 5 to 18 months before your claim start date. You can be paid benefits for a maximum of 52 weeks. For more information, review [Calculating Disability Benefit Payment Amounts](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/).\n\nTo receive benefits, you must:\n\n* File a claim for DI benefits using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) or [by mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/).\n* Complete a seven-day, unpaid waiting period.\n* Have earned at least $300 in wages that are subject to SDI deductions (“CASDI” on your paystubs) during the 12-month [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) of your claim.\n* Have your physician/practitioner certify to your disability by completing the Physician/Practitioner Certification.\n* Choose your payment option when you file your claim:\n\t+ Direct Deposit (SDI Online claims only)\n\t+ Debit card\n\t+ Check\n\nTo learn more, review the following:\n\n* [Disability Insurance - Overview](/en/disability/disability_insurance/)\n* [DI Benefits and Payments FAQs](/en/disability/faqs-benefits-payments/)\n* [Disability Insurance Provisions (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de2515.pdf)\n* [Your Benefit Payment Options](/en/about_edd/your-benefit-payment-options/)"},

Contact us at 1-866-758-9768 to get medical extension forms.\n\nYour employer will complete and sign **Part A - Employer Information**.\n\nYou will complete and sign **Part B - Claim Statement of Employee**.\n\nThings to Know About Your Claim Start Date\n\n* The day you became unable to work due to your disability is the **date your disability begins**.\n* You can file your claim after the first day your disability begins.\n* If you have any questions about your claim start date, **before** filing your claim contact us at 1-866-758-9768 .\n* Your claim may have a 7 or 10 day waiting period.  Check with your Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or personnel specialist for additional details about your waiting period.\n\n## Manage Your Claim\n\n### Receiving Benefits\n\nYour employer issues benefit payments of up to $250 per week for 26 weeks (182 days) with a waiting period of 7 or 10 days. The benefit amount and rules about using leave credits vary based on your employment status and bargaining unit.\n\nIf you participate in the California’s annual leave program, you are eligible to receive Enhanced NDI (ENDI) benefits of 50% of your gross pay. This can be supplemented with leave credits at 75% or 100%.\n\nState and federal taxes will be withheld from NDI benefits. Voluntary deductions, such as health insurance premiums, credit union loans, savings accounts, bonds, and parking fees, will automatically be deducted from NDI benefits unless you cancel. If you continue to deduct your health insurance premium, your employer’s contribution will also continue.\n\n### Get a Medical Certification\n\nMedical certifications are required for disability and caregiver claims to receive NDI or NDI-FCL benefits.\n\nUnlike SDI, NDI is not an automated program. Paper forms still need to be filled out to begin or extend the medical portion of a claim.\n\nTalk to your licensed health professional about their process for submitting a medical certification (not all medical offices follow the same steps or process).\n\n**Note:** Your claim is not complete until your licensed health professional completes a medical certification.\n\nYou can get medical extension forms by contacting us at 1-866-758-9768.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\nFor more information about NDI, refer to:\n\n* [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance FAQs](/en/disability/nonindustrial/faqs/)\n* [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance Claim Process](/en/disability/nonindustrial/claim-process/)\n* [Family Care Leave (NDI-FCL) Overview](/en/disability/nonindustrial/family-care-leave/)\n* [CalHR](http://calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/non-industrial-disability-insurance.aspx)"},

Review Your Eligibility\n\nYou must be eligible to receive DI benefits.

You can file your claim using [SDI Online](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_in_sdi_online/) (recommended) or by submitting the *Claim for Disability Insurance (DI) Benefits* (DE 2501) by mail.\n\nFor more information, review:\n\n* [How to File a Disability Insurance Claim in SDI Online](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_in_sdi_online/)\n* [How to File a Disability Insurance Claim by Mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/)\n\n**Note:** The EDD will not process your claim until your application is properly completed.\n\n#### Your Claim Start Date\n\nTo be eligible for benefits, you must be losing wages because your disability is preventing your regular work. This means you're not working or you're working reduced hours.\n\nThe first day you can't do your regular work because of your disability is **the date your disability begins**. You **may not** change the start date of your claim or adjust your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) after establishing a valid claim. A valid claim means there are still wages in your base period. \n\n**Important:** The base claim period for a pregnancy disability claim and the resulting weekly benefit amount is the same one that will be used for the following Paid Family Leave bonding claim for new mothers.\n\nIf you have any questions about your claim start date, contact DI at 1-800-480-3287 **before** filing your claim.\n\n#### When to File Your Claim\n\nYou can file your claim on the first day of your disability, but to avoid creating delays on your claim, losing benefits, or having your claim disqualified, you should file your claim:\n\n* No earlier than nine days after your disability begins.\n* No later than 49 days after your disability begins.\n\n**Note:** If you have a good reason for filing late, include a letter to explain your reasons when you file your claim so the claims analyst can review your information to make a determination.\n\nChoose your [payment option](/en/about_edd/your-benefit-payment-options/) when you file your claim:\n\n* Direct deposit (SDI Online claims only)\n* Debit card\n* Check\n\n### 3.

It is **your responsibility** to have your licensed health professional complete and sign the certification and submit it to us within 49 days from the date your disability begins so you don't lose benefits or have your claim disqualified.\n\n* A nurse practitioner may certify to a disability within their scope of practice; however, they must perform a physical examination and collaborate with a physician or surgeon.\n* A licensed midwife, nurse-midwife, or nurse practitioner may complete the medical certification for disabilities related to normal pregnancy or childbirth.\n* If you are under the care of an accredited religious practitioner, you can download and print the [*Claim for Disability Insurance Benefits-Religious Practitioner’s Certificate* (DE 2502) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de2502.pdf) for them to complete.\n\n**Note:** Your claim is not complete until your licensed health professional completes a medical certification.\n\n### 4. Eligibility Status Determined\n\nOnce we receive your completed claim application, we will determine your eligibility. You can expect this process to take up to 14 days.\n\n**Note:** Processing time may vary depending upon the claim. If your claim is incomplete or requires additional information, confirming eligibility can be delayed.\n\nDuring this time, we will send you a *Notice of Computation* (DE 429D) to inform you of your potential weekly benefit amount based on the wages you earned in your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/).  \n  \n**Note:** Receiving this notice does not confirm your eligibility to receive DI benefits.\n\n**Eligible for Benefits**  \nIf you are eligible for benefits, we will send you an *Electronic Benefit Payment Notification* (DE 2500E) with information about your first benefit payment.\n\nBefore you receive benefits, you must serve an unpaid seven-day waiting period (calendar days).

With your final payment, we will mail you a *Physician/Practitioner’s Supplementary Certificate* (DE 2525XX).\n\nIf you have not fully recovered and want to continue benefits, you must have your physician/practitioner complete the DE 2525XX and return the form to us to certify your continuing disability. Your physician/practitioner may complete and submit the DE 2525XX using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) or by [mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/).\n\n### Discontinue Benefits\n\n**Stop Benefits If You Have Recovered or Returned to Work**  \nIf you recover or return to work on the date your physician/practitioner provided to us, no further action is required to stop your claim.\n\nIf you have been approved to go back to work **before** the physician/practitioner’s estimated date of recovery, complete one of the following:\n\n* The Disability Status section of the *Claim for Continued Disability Benefits* (DE 2500A).\n* The Recovery or Return to Work Certification portion of the *Notice of Automatic Payment* (DE 2587).\n* Question 1 of the *Disability Claim Continuing Eligibility Questionnaire* (DE 2593).\n* Use the **Claim Update** function on [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).\n\nIf you previously recovered or returned to work and became ill or injured again, immediately file a new claim form (DE 2501) and report the dates you worked.", "nonaccordion": "Disability Insurance (DI) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers.\n\n## Follow These Steps", "accordions": {"1.

These are licensed health professionals responsible for the supplemental examinations that verify a disability status by providing a second medical opinion when the original certification is in question. Examinations by the SDI program follow the guidelines listed in [Section 2627(c)-1(b) of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I06F3D3C0D4B711DE8879F88E8B0DAAAE&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29#IC10399C8AA3641A2B98947DD7AC9FD55).\n\nFor example, SDI may request an examination if a licensed health professional lists the claimant’s disability as lasting longer than what is considered normal for the diagnosis but doesn’t provide a medically justified reason.\n\nIndependent medical examinations assist SDI in preserving the Disability Fund for the benefit of workers who are insured through SDI.\n\n### How to Become an Independent Medical Examiner\n\nIf you are a licensed health professional and would like to become an Independent Medical Examiner, contact us by emailing [DIBMedical@edd.ca.gov](mailto:DIBMedical@edd.ca.gov) or at the mailing address below.

You should also be aware that the State has a [Privacy Policy](/en/about_edd/privacy_policy/), also available on this website. The State wants you to know about the collection, use, security, and access to information that may be obtained through use of the State’s web portal. By visiting this website, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Notice. This Notice covers the topics listed below.\n\nPlease note that this Use Policy is subject to change without notice, and that it reflects the State’s current business practices. This Use policy is dated December 7, 2000.\n\nAlso note that each department within the State may have additional privacy and use policies specific to the mission and needs of their work. Be sure to review those policies as you access additional sites within the State.\n\nShow All\n\n## [Personal Information and Choice](#collapse-96a999ac-fa09-4092-adb8-f3a2df449907)\n\n\"Personal information\" is information about a natural person that identifies or describes an individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and medical or employment history, readily identifiable to that specific individual. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information; however, it is considered \"electronically collected personal information.\"\n\nAccording to Government Code § 11015.5., \"electronically collected personal information\" means any information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual user, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, medical or employment history, password, electronic mail address, and information that reveals any network location or identity, but excludes any information manually submitted to a State agency by a user, whether electronically or in written form, and information on or relating to individuals who are users, serving in a business capacity, including, but not limited to, business owners, officers, or principals of that business.\n\n\"Electronically collected personal information\" that we automatically collect includes your domain name or Internet Protocol address, and statistical information about which web pages you visit. If you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for specific information (i.e., completing a request for assistance, personalizing the content of the website, sending an email, or participating in a survey) more detailed data will be collected. If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the website.\n\nIf any type of personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by the user, State law, including the Information Practices Act of 1977, Government Code Section 11015.5., and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information may be a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by federal or State law.\n\nAdditionally, departments and agencies of the State of California under the authority of the Governor are required to adhere to the Privacy Policy which is also accessible on this website.\n\n## [A Special Note about Children](#collapse-ebe09900-d1d9-4ebd-ac67-cce5d81eabf1)\n\nChildren are not eligible to use services that require submission of personal information, and we require that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. This includes submitting personal information to the State as part of a user profile or personalization profile. If you are a minor, you can use these services only if used together with your parents or guardians. If you are a minor, you should seek guidance from your parents.\n\nIf the State decides to begin collecting personal information from children, it will notify parents that it is being requested, disclose the reasons for collecting it, and disclose our intended use of it. The State will seek parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information. If it does collect it, parents may request information on the type of data being collected, view their child’s information, and, if they choose, prohibit the State from making further use of their child’s information. The State will not provide personal information about children to third parties.\n\n## [Information Collected and How It Is Used](#collapse-2604f6bf-f717-4c4b-8737-0d620d781710)\n\nWe do collect personal information directly from individuals who volunteer to use some of our services.

The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used, but not the email address. The Internet Protocol Address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you and generate statistics used in the management of this site;\n2. The type of browser and operating system you used;\n3. The date and time you visited this site;\n4. The web pages or services you accessed at this site;\n5. The website you visited prior to coming to this website;\n6. The website you visit as you leave this website; and\n7. If you downloaded a form, the form that was downloaded.\n\nThe information we automatically collect or store is used to improve the content of our web services and to help us understand how people are using our services. This information does not identify you personally and is used for gathering website statistics. The information we automatically collect and store in our logs about your visit helps us to analyze our website to continually improve the value of the materials available. Our website logs do not identify a visitor by personal information, and we make no attempt to link other websites with the individuals that browse the State’s website.\n\nGovernment Code § 11015.5.(a)(6) prohibits all state agencies from distributing or selling any electronically collected personal information, as defined above, about users to any third party without the permission of the user. The State does not sell any \"electronically collected personal information.\" Any distribution of \"electronically collected personal information\" will be solely for the purposes for which it was provided to us.\n\nThe State may provide or distribute certain lists and statistical reports of regulatory information as provided by law, but no personal information is sold or distributed, and all relevant legal protections still apply to the State’s websites.\n\n## [What Happens To Information You Submit To Us?](#collapse-f9d8683b-3762-4764-a7b5-4e9bfbbf8b3d)\n\nIf you choose to submit information to us, the information will be transmitted through secure lines to our departmental database. Any private information will only be used for the purposes for which it was provided and will not be shared with another entity except as prescribed by law. Please see our Privacy Policy for additional information.\n\n## [Use of Internet Request for Assistance Form Information](#collapse-02e13d9b-f916-49f6-aba6-e3dc9276dff7)\n\nAny information you provide to us will only be shared with entities involved in your case as necessary. Information you provide may be included with other consumers’ information to be used for statistical reporting, trending data, and/or investigative actions. For example, we may need to retain information that becomes part of an enforcement action or consumer complaint case for a period of time after the closing date of the case.\n\nIf you provide us with information regarding an issue that does not fall within our regulatory jurisdiction, we may refer your information to the appropriate local, State, or federal agency on your behalf.\n\n## [Surveys](#collapse-b54ceb11-90fe-4339-b755-d92fa840a3f0)\n\nIf during your visit to the State’s website you participate in a survey or send an email, the following additional information will be collected:\n\n1. The email address and contents of the email; and\n2. Information volunteered in response to the survey.\n\nThe information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.\n\nThe information is retained in accordance with Government Code § 11015.5.\n\n## [If You Send Us Email](#collapse-62e911f0-e4d0-4e20-b9a9-22aa117dbde3)\n\nYou may choose to provide us with personal information, as in email with a comment or question. We use the information to improve our service to you or to respond to your request. Sometimes we forward your email to other State employees who may be better able to help you, and this staff may be employed by a different agency within the State. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations or, as required by law, we do not share our email with any other organizations.\n\nWe use your email to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to further improve our website, or to forward the email to another agency for appropriate action.\n\n## [Order Forms](#collapse-f58456b8-263f-4ada-bae0-d7ab993a51ff)\n\nIf you place an order with us, we request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your order/request. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you.\n\n## [Public Disclosure](#collapse-247ff7a5-21f2-4a02-a4bb-11cb0300a4f5)\n\nIn the State of California, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by State government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public’s right to access public records. These exceptions serve various needs including maintaining the privacy of individuals. Both State and federal laws provide exceptions.\n\nAll information collected at this site becomes public record that may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists. In the event of a conflict between this Use Policy and the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, or other law governing the disclosure of records, the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, or other applicable law will control.\n\n## [Automatic Collection of Information/Cookies](#collapse-b6a00292-cca9-48b3-a090-f77b83a80096)\n\nWhen you visit a State of California website, you should be aware that data linking your computer to a particular website (a “cookie”) may be created.
