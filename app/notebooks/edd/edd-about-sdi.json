The illness or injury can be physical or mental and can include elective surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical conditions.\n\n**For Family Care Leave:** [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance - Family Care Leave (NDI-FCL)](/en/disability/nonindustrial/family-care-leave/) provides partial wage replacement to eligible state employees who are enrolled in the Annual Leave Program (ALP) and are excluded from bargaining or are an employee represented by a specific bargaining unit that has NDI-FCL language in their Memorandum of Understanding.\n\n## Who is covered?\n\nNDI benefits are available to:\n\n* Permanent or probationary full-time or intermittent employees in “compensated employment” (in pay status and not separated by a formal leave of absence) who are members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) or the State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS).\n* Employees who are excluded from collective bargaining and are full-time, permanent part-time, or intermittent officers or employees of the State Legislature, who are not civil service members.\n* California State University employees appointed half-time or more for either one year of service or one academic year or more, are also covered.\n\n**Note:** Permanent part-time and intermittent employees must have the equivalent of six monthly pay periods of service in the past 18 months. These periods must come immediately before the pay period the disability begins. These employees are eligible on a prorated basis.\n\nNo employee contributions, enrollment fees, or medical examinations are required to be covered.\n\n* [## Getting Started](#pane-9553a697-eee9-48f4-9d1f-1f7536b8b0e5)\n* [## File a Claim](#pane-701d9153-f7b1-4c92-831e-a93552c50f2a)\n* [## Manage Your Claim](#pane-89435088-1a71-4737-948d-7dd8396f5f6e)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Eligibility Requirements\n\nNDI covers excluded employees and rank-and-file employees in bargaining units 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, and 19. [CalHR](http://calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/non-industrial-disability-insurance.aspx) is responsible for contract administration.\n\nFor state employees in bargaining units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21, you will be covered by [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/).\n\nTo be eligible for NDI benefits, you must:\n\n* Be a State employee who is not covered by SDI.\n* Be unable to do your normal and usual work for at least eight days due to a non-work-related disability.\n* Have lost wages because of your disability.\n* Be under the care and treatment of a licensed health professional or accredited religious practitioner within the first eight days of your disability. The date your claim begins can be adjusted if it does not meet this requirement. You must remain under care and treatment to continue receiving benefits.\n\n### Forms and Publications\n\nConnect with your employer’s personnel specialist or payroll officer to obtain the NDI claim forms DE 8501 and DE 8501F.

Contact us at 1-866-758-9768 to get medical extension forms.\n\nYour employer will complete and sign **Part A - Employer Information**.\n\nYou will complete and sign **Part B - Claim Statement of Employee**.\n\nThings to Know About Your Claim Start Date\n\n* The day you became unable to work due to your disability is the **date your disability begins**.\n* You can file your claim after the first day your disability begins.\n* If you have any questions about your claim start date, **before** filing your claim contact us at 1-866-758-9768 .\n* Your claim may have a 7 or 10 day waiting period.  Check with your Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or personnel specialist for additional details about your waiting period.\n\n## Manage Your Claim\n\n### Receiving Benefits\n\nYour employer issues benefit payments of up to $250 per week for 26 weeks (182 days) with a waiting period of 7 or 10 days. The benefit amount and rules about using leave credits vary based on your employment status and bargaining unit.\n\nIf you participate in the California’s annual leave program, you are eligible to receive Enhanced NDI (ENDI) benefits of 50% of your gross pay. This can be supplemented with leave credits at 75% or 100%.\n\nState and federal taxes will be withheld from NDI benefits. Voluntary deductions, such as health insurance premiums, credit union loans, savings accounts, bonds, and parking fees, will automatically be deducted from NDI benefits unless you cancel. If you continue to deduct your health insurance premium, your employer’s contribution will also continue.\n\n### Get a Medical Certification\n\nMedical certifications are required for disability and caregiver claims to receive NDI or NDI-FCL benefits.\n\nUnlike SDI, NDI is not an automated program. Paper forms still need to be filled out to begin or extend the medical portion of a claim.\n\nTalk to your licensed health professional about their process for submitting a medical certification (not all medical offices follow the same steps or process).\n\n**Note:** Your claim is not complete until your licensed health professional completes a medical certification.\n\nYou can get medical extension forms by contacting us at 1-866-758-9768.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\nFor more information about NDI, refer to:\n\n* [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance FAQs](/en/disability/nonindustrial/faqs/)\n* [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance Claim Process](/en/disability/nonindustrial/claim-process/)\n* [Family Care Leave (NDI-FCL) Overview](/en/disability/nonindustrial/family-care-leave/)\n* [CalHR](http://calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/non-industrial-disability-insurance.aspx)"},

Review Your Eligibility\n\nYou must be eligible to receive DI benefits. Some requirements are:\n\n* You aren't able to do your regular work for at least eight consecutive days.\n* You've lost wages because of your disability.\n* You're employed or actively looking for work at the time your disability began.\n* You're being treated by a licensed health professional.\n\nView the complete list of [eligibility requirements](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_DI_Benefits/).\n\n**Note:** Citizenship and immigration status do not affect eligibility.\n\nYou may also be interested in visiting:\n\n* [Calculating DI Benefit Payment Amounts](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/)\n* [Integration of Benefits](/en/disability/integration-coordination/)\n* [Part Time Intermittent Reduced Work Schedule](/en/disability/part-time_intermittent_reduced_work_schedule/)\n* [Voluntary Plan](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/)\n* [Self-Employed – Eligibility for Disability Insurance Elective Coverage](/en/disability/Self-Employed_Eligibility/)\n\n### 2. File Your Claim\n\nYou have two [options to file for DI benefits](/en/disability/options_to_file_for_di_benefits/). You can file your claim using [SDI Online](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_in_sdi_online/) (recommended) or by submitting the *Claim for Disability Insurance (DI) Benefits* (DE 2501) by mail.\n\nFor more information, review:\n\n* [How to File a Disability Insurance Claim in SDI Online](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_in_sdi_online/)\n* [How to File a Disability Insurance Claim by Mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/)\n\n**Note:** The EDD will not process your claim until your application is properly completed.\n\n#### Your Claim Start Date\n\nTo be eligible for benefits, you must be losing wages because your disability is preventing your regular work. This means you're not working or you're working reduced hours.\n\nThe first day you can't do your regular work because of your disability is **the date your disability begins**. You **may not** change the start date of your claim or adjust your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) after establishing a valid claim. A valid claim means there are still wages in your base period. \n\n**Important:** The base claim period for a pregnancy disability claim and the resulting weekly benefit amount is the same one that will be used for the following Paid Family Leave bonding claim for new mothers.\n\nIf you have any questions about your claim start date, contact DI at 1-800-480-3287 **before** filing your claim.\n\n#### When to File Your Claim\n\nYou can file your claim on the first day of your disability, but to avoid creating delays on your claim, losing benefits, or having your claim disqualified, you should file your claim:\n\n* No earlier than nine days after your disability begins.\n* No later than 49 days after your disability begins.\n\n**Note:** If you have a good reason for filing late, include a letter to explain your reasons when you file your claim so the claims analyst can review your information to make a determination.\n\nChoose your [payment option](/en/about_edd/your-benefit-payment-options/) when you file your claim:\n\n* Direct deposit (SDI Online claims only)\n* Debit card\n* Check\n\n### 3. Get a Medical Certification\n\nYour licensed health professional must certify to your disability by completing and submitting the medical certification using either SDI Online or the DE 2501 *Part B – Physician/Practitioner’s Certificate* of the paper claim form. It is **your responsibility** to have your licensed health professional complete and sign the certification and submit it to us within 49 days from the date your disability begins so you don't lose benefits or have your claim disqualified.\n\n* A nurse practitioner may certify to a disability within their scope of practice; however, they must perform a physical examination and collaborate with a physician or surgeon.\n* A licensed midwife, nurse-midwife, or nurse practitioner may complete the medical certification for disabilities related to normal pregnancy or childbirth.\n* If you are under the care of an accredited religious practitioner, you can download and print the [*Claim for Disability Insurance Benefits-Religious Practitioner’s Certificate* (DE 2502) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de2502.pdf) for them to complete.\n\n**Note:** Your claim is not complete until your licensed health professional completes a medical certification.\n\n### 4. Eligibility Status Determined\n\nOnce we receive your completed claim application, we will determine your eligibility. You can expect this process to take up to 14 days.\n\n**Note:** Processing time may vary depending upon the claim. If your claim is incomplete or requires additional information, confirming eligibility can be delayed.\n\nDuring this time, we will send you a *Notice of Computation* (DE 429D) to inform you of your potential weekly benefit amount based on the wages you earned in your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/).  \n  \n**Note:** Receiving this notice does not confirm your eligibility to receive DI benefits.\n\n**Eligible for Benefits**  \nIf you are eligible for benefits, we will send you an *Electronic Benefit Payment Notification* (DE 2500E) with information about your first benefit payment.\n\nBefore you receive benefits, you must serve an unpaid seven-day waiting period (calendar days). The first payable day is the eighth day of the claim.\n\nReview the [DI Benefits and Payments FAQs](/en/disability/faqs-benefits-payments/) for more information.\n\n### If We Can't Determine Your Eligibility\n\nWe'll contact you by phone or mail for more information. We may also need to contact your employer or licensed health professional.\n\n**Not Eligible for Benefits**  \nIf you are not eligible, we will send you a *Notice of Determination* (DE 2517) and an *Appeal Form* (DE 1000A). You have the right to [appeal](/en/disability/appeals/) any decision by completing the DE 1000A electronically or by mail within 30 days of the date your form was issued.\n\n### 5. Continue or Stop Your Benefits\n\n### Continue Benefits\n\n**If You’re Receiving Automatic Payments**  \nIf you are on automatic payment, we will send you a *Disability Claim Continuing Eligibility Certification* (DE 2593) after 10 weeks of payment. You must return this form to us to certify that your disability continues. If you do not return the DE 2593, your benefits will stop.\n\n**If You’re Not Receiving Automatic Payments**  \nIf you are not on automatic payment, we will send you a *Claim for Continued Disability Benefits* (DE 2500A) every two weeks to certify that your disability continues. If you do not return the DE 2500A, your benefits will stop.\n\nThe quickest way to submit the DE 2593 or DE 2500A is through [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).\n\n**Extend Your Benefit Period If You Have Not Recovered**  \nYou may be eligible to receive benefits through the return-to-work or recovery date your physician/practitioner provides us. With your final payment, we will mail you a *Physician/Practitioner’s Supplementary Certificate* (DE 2525XX).\n\nIf you have not fully recovered and want to continue benefits, you must have your physician/practitioner complete the DE 2525XX and return the form to us to certify your continuing disability. Your physician/practitioner may complete and submit the DE 2525XX using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) or by [mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/).\n\n### Discontinue Benefits\n\n**Stop Benefits If You Have Recovered or Returned to Work**  \nIf you recover or return to work on the date your physician/practitioner provided to us, no further action is required to stop your claim.\n\nIf you have been approved to go back to work **before** the physician/practitioner’s estimated date of recovery, complete one of the following:\n\n* The Disability Status section of the *Claim for Continued Disability Benefits* (DE 2500A).\n* The Recovery or Return to Work Certification portion of the *Notice of Automatic Payment* (DE 2587).\n* Question 1 of the *Disability Claim Continuing Eligibility Questionnaire* (DE 2593).\n* Use the **Claim Update** function on [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).\n\nIf you previously recovered or returned to work and became ill or injured again, immediately file a new claim form (DE 2501) and report the dates you worked.", "nonaccordion": "Disability Insurance (DI) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers.\n\n## Follow These Steps", "accordions": {"1.

All service credit is earned for time worked or supplemented with the leave you earn.\n\n### Benefit Payment Exceptions\n\nBenefits are not payable for any day that you:\n\n* Are eligible for temporary [workers’ compensation benefits](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) or [Industrial Disability Leave](https://www.dgs.ca.gov/OHR/Resources/Page-Content/Office-of-Human-Resources-Resources-List-Folder/Personnel-Operations-Manual/Industrial-Disability-Leave).\n* Receive full wages in the form of sick leave, vacation, compensatory time off, or catastrophic leave.\n* Are paid unemployment benefits.\n* Are separated or retired from state service.\n\nFor more information about NDI and NDI claim filing, visit the [NonIndustrial Disability Insurance](/en/disability/nonindustrial/) page or ask your personnel specialist."},

For more information, visit the [Certify and Manage Claims - Basics for Licensed Health Professionals](/en/disability/Basics_for_Physicians-Practitioners/) page.\n\n**Note:** You will need to complete an identity and medical license verification through ID.me to register an account and use SDI Online.\n\n## Independent Medical Examiner Information\n\nThe State Disability Insurance (SDI) program has a panel of Independent Medical Examiners. These are licensed health professionals responsible for the supplemental examinations that verify a disability status by providing a second medical opinion when the original certification is in question. Examinations by the SDI program follow the guidelines listed in [Section 2627(c)-1(b) of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I06F3D3C0D4B711DE8879F88E8B0DAAAE&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29#IC10399C8AA3641A2B98947DD7AC9FD55).\n\nFor example, SDI may request an examination if a licensed health professional lists the claimant’s disability as lasting longer than what is considered normal for the diagnosis but doesn’t provide a medically justified reason.\n\nIndependent medical examinations assist SDI in preserving the Disability Fund for the benefit of workers who are insured through SDI.\n\n### How to Become an Independent Medical Examiner\n\nIf you are a licensed health professional and would like to become an Independent Medical Examiner, contact us by emailing [DIBMedical@edd.ca.gov](mailto:DIBMedical@edd.ca.gov) or at the mailing address below. Please provide us with a contact phone number, email, and mailing address.
