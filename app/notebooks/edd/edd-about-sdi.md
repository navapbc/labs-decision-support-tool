How to File a Disability Insurance Claim by Mail https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

If you think you're [eligible for benefits](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_DI_Benefits/), file a claim to apply. You can file a claim by mail or even faster with [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).

Note: If any of the following apply, you should file a paper claim form instead of filing online:

* You do not have a valid California driver license or ID.
* You do not have a valid SSN.
* You have a name that does not fit the space in the online form.
* You had a recent name change.
* You received an error code you cannot resolve or have any other difficulty filing an application online.

Follow these steps to file a Disability Insurance (DI) claim by mail.

## Step 1: Get Your Claim Form

You can get a paper *Claim for Disability Insurance (DI) Benefits* (DE 2501) form by:

* Ordering a [form online](https://forms.edd.ca.gov/forms) to have it mailed to you.
* Getting the form from your licensed health professional or employer.
* Visiting an [SDI Office](https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/Contact_SDI/).
* Calling 1-800-480-3287 and selecting DI Information option 3 to request a paper form by mail.

**Note**: Allow up to ten days to receive this form.

## Step 2: Gather Required Information

You **must**provide the following information to file a DI claim:

* First and last name.
* Most current employer’s business name, phone number, and mailing address (as stated on your W-2 or paystub).
* Last date you worked your normal or usual duties (or the date you began working less than full or modified duty).

You must also give the following information **only**if it applies to you:

* Any wages you received or expect to receive from your employer (sick leave, paid time off (PTO), vacation pay, annual leave, and wages earned after you stopped working).
* Any [workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) claim information.
* If you receive in-patient treatment at an alcohol recovery home or drug-free rehabilitation facility, provide the name, address, and phone number of the home or facility.

Note: The facility must be licensed and certified by the state in which the facility is located.

## Step 3: Complete Part A: Claimant’s Statement (DE 2501)

You are responsible for filling out Part A - Claimant’s Statement of the DE 2501 form. Write clearly in the spaces provided. Fill out the form completely using black ink only, and sign the form. An incomplete form could delay processing.

## Step 4: Get Your Licensed Health Professional to Complete Part B: Medical Certification

You must get a licensed health professional certification for your disability. Once you have filled out Part A of the DE 2501 form, contact your licensed health professional about completing, signing, and submitting your medical certification (Part B – Physician/professional’s Certificate).

Talk to your licensed health professional about their process for submitting a DI claim (not all of them follow the same process). Your licensed health professional must submit the certification no later than 49 days after your disability begins or you may lose benefits.

* If your licensed health professional wants to submit the medical certification using SDI Online, allow 14 calendar days for us to receive and process your claim.
* After your claim has been received, your licensed health professional can find your claim in [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).

## Step 5: Mail in Your Completed DI Claim Form (DE 2501)

There are two parts to completing this form. For your claim to be considered complete, both parts of the DE 2501 form need to be submitted:

* Part A - Claimant’s Statement
* Part B - Physician/professional’s Medical Certificate (a licensed health professional can submit this part)

You can file your claim on the first day of your disability, but to avoid creating delays on your claim, losing benefits, or having your claim disqualified, you should file your claim:

* No earlier than nine days after your disability begins.
* No later than 49 days after your disability begins

If you have a good reason for filing late, please provide that explanation when you file your claim so the claims analyst can review your information to make a determination.

Your claim will not be processed until we receive both part A and part B.

Use the pre-addressed envelope to mail to:

State of California  
Employment Development Department  
PO Box 989777  
West Sacramento, CA 95798-9777

Do not submit the same claim more than once. This will delay your claim.

**Note:** Your employer will be notified that you have submitted a DI claim. However, medical information is confidential and will not be shared with your employer.

For more information on how to file a DI claim using SDI Online, view our [Claimant Tutorials](/en/disability/SDI_Online_Tutorials/) and an outline on the [Disability Insurance Claim Process](/en/disability/DI_Claim_Process/).

About the State Disability Insurance Program https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/About_the_State_Disability_Insurance_SDI_Program

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

More than 18 million California workers are covered by the California State Disability Insurance (SDI) program. SDI is a partial wage-replacement insurance plan for eligible California workers. SDI is a deduction from employees’ wages. This is usually shown as “CASDI” on your paystub.

If you are covered by SDI, the following benefits are available to you:

## Disability Insurance

Disability Insurance (DI) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers who have a loss of wages when they are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy.

DI does not provide job protection, only monetary benefits; however, your job may be protected through other federal or state laws such as the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) or the [California Family Rights Act (CFRA)](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/).

* [Work-related illness or injury: Workers’ Compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/)

If you think you’re eligible for disability benefits, you’ll want to file a claim to apply.

## Paid Family Leave

Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides benefits to people who need to take time off work to:

* Care for a seriously ill child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner.
* Bond with a new child entering the family through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.
* Participate in a qualifying event resulting from an eligible family member’s military deployment to a foreign country.

## SDI for State Employees

State employees are divided into 21 bargaining units. SDI covers employees in bargaining units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21.  
SDI pays part of an employee’s wages if they have to stop working due to any of the following:

* A non-work-related illness or injury.
* A pregnancy or to bond with a new child entering the family through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.
* To care for a seriously ill child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner.

Disability Insurance Eligibility Requirements https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_DI_Benefits/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

## Am I Eligible for Disability Insurance Benefits?

Disability Insurance (DI) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers.

You may be eligible for DI if you are unable to work and are losing wages because of your own non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy.

### Requirements to File a Claim

In order to be eligible for DI benefits, you must:

* Be unable to do your regular or customary work for at least eight days.
* Have lost wages because of your disability.
* Be employed or actively looking for work at the time your disability begins.
* Have earned at least $300 from which State Disability Insurance (SDI) deductions were withheld during your base period. Learn more with [Calculating Benefit Payment Amounts](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/).
* Be under the care and treatment of a licensed physician/practitioner or accredited religious practitioner within the first eight days of your disability. The date your claim begins can be adjusted if it does not meet this requirement. You must remain under care and treatment to continue receiving benefits.

Complete and submit your *Claim for Disability Insurance (DI) Benefits*(DE 2501) on time. You can file your claim on the first day of your disability, but to avoid creating delays on your claim, losing benefits, or having your claim disqualified, you should file your claim:

* No earlier than nine days after your disability begins.
* No later than 49 days after your disability begins.

If you have a good reason for filing late, please provide that explanation when you file your claim so the claims analyst can review your information to make a determination.

Have your physician/practitioner complete the medical certification portion of your disability claim.

* A nurse practitioner may certify to a disability within their scope of practice.
* A licensed midwife, nurse-midwife, or nurse practitioner may complete the medical certification for disabilities related to normal pregnancy or childbirth.
* If you are under the care of an accredited religious practitioner, you may download and print the [*Claim for Disability Insurance Benefits-Religious Practitioner’s Certificate* (DE 2502) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de2502.pdf).

**A note for misclassified workers**: If you think your employer has misclassified you as an independent contractor, you should still apply for DI and let us decide your eligibility.

#### Additional Information

* Citizenship and immigration status do not affect eligibility.
* Your employer will be notified that you have submitted a DI claim. However, your medical information is confidential and will not be shared with your employer.
* School employees are not eligible for DI benefits when receiving full wages or for school break periods unless they normally work another job during the school break for extra income. Visit [Disability Insurance – Eligibility FAQs](/en/disability/FAQ_DI_Eligibility/) or [Contact DI](/en/disability/Contact_SDI/) for more information.

**Note:** An independent medical examination to determine your initial or continuing eligibility may be required.

About Disability Insurance https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/About_DI/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Disability Insurance (DI) is a part of the [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/About_the_State_Disability_Insurance_SDI_Program/) program. It provides partial wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers who are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy. SDI contributions are paid by California workers through employee payroll deductions.

DI does not provide job protection, only monetary benefits; however, your job may be protected through other federal or state laws such as the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) or the [California Family Rights Act (CFRA)](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I6A8A63F05A0A11EC8227000D3A7C4BC3&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)).

## Disability Insurance

Disability is an illness or injury, either physical or mental, which prevents you from performing your regular and customary work. Disability also includes elective surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical conditions.

Although work-related disabilities are covered by workers’ compensation laws, DI benefits may also be paid for work-related illness or injuries under certain circumstances. You can learn more about the difference between [workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) and DI.

## Disability Insurance Benefit Payments

If you are eligible, you can receive about 60 to 70 percent (depending on income) of wages earned 5 to 18 months before your claim start date. You can be paid benefits for a maximum of 52 weeks. For more information, review [Calculating Disability Benefit Payment Amounts](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/).

To receive benefits, you must:

* File a claim for DI benefits using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) or [by mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/).
* Complete a seven-day, unpaid waiting period.
* Have earned at least $300 in wages that are subject to SDI deductions (“CASDI” on your paystubs) during the 12-month [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) of your claim.
* Have your physician/practitioner certify to your disability by completing the Physician/Practitioner Certification.
* Choose your payment option when you file your claim:
	+ Direct Deposit (SDI Online claims only)
	+ Debit card
	+ Check

To learn more, review the following:

* [Disability Insurance - Overview](/en/disability/disability_insurance/)
* [DI Benefits and Payments FAQs](/en/disability/faqs-benefits-payments/)

## Disability Insurance Claim

[Disability Insurance (DI)](/en/disability/disability_insurance/) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to [eligible](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_DI_Benefits/) California workers who are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy.

Your claim begins when you have a loss of wages and your physician/practitioner certifies that your disability prevents you from doing your normal or usual job duties.

## Pregnancy

Your pregnancy claim begins when you have a loss of wages and your physician/practitioner confirms that you are unable to do your normal or usual job duties.

The usual disability period for a normal pregnancy is up to four weeks before the expected delivery date and up to six weeks (for normal delivery) or eight weeks (for Cesarean section) after the actual delivery. However, your physician/practitioner may certify to a longer disability period prior to or after delivery if there are medical complications and if you are unable to perform your normal or usual job duties.

Your post-partum benefits are limited to the period that you are actually unable to do your normal or usual work.

**Note:** New mothers transitioning from a DI-related pregnancy claim to PFL-related bonding should remember that when you have recovered from delivering your baby, a *Claim for Paid Family Leave (PFL) Benefits – New Mother* (DE 2501FP) will be automatically mailed to you in a separate envelope at the same time your final DI payment is issued.

## Paid Family Leave Bonding Claim

Paid Family Leave (PFL) Bonding provides benefits to eligible workers who need to take time off work to bond with a new child entering the family by birth, adoption, or foster care placement.

You can get more information on the [Paid Parental Leave Ordinance (PPLO)](https://sf.gov/information/understanding-paid-parental-leave-ordinance) from the City and County of San Francisco, Office of Labor Standards Enforcement.

## Paid Family Leave Care Claim

Paid Family Leave (PFL) Care provides benefits to [eligible](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_PFL_Benefits/) workers who need to take time off work to care for a seriously ill:

* Child
* Parent
* Parent-in-law
* Grandparent
* Grandchild
* Sibling
* Spouse or registered domestic partner

PFL defines a serious health condition as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition of a patient that requires:

* At-home care or in-patient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility.
* Continuing treatment by a physician or health care practitioner.

Unless there are complications, the following are examples of conditions that do not qualify as a serious condition for PFL.

* Cosmetic treatments
* Common cold
* Flu
* Earaches
* Upset stomach
* Minor ulcers
* Non-migraine headaches

* [State Disability Insurance (SDI) FAQs](/en/disability/Faqs/)

## Paid Family Leave Military Assist Claim

PFL now offers benefits to California workers who take time off work to participate in a qualifying event because of an eligible family member’s (spouse, registered domestic partner, parent, or child) military deployment to a foreign country.

A qualifying event is any military event or an essential need resulting from the family member’s call to deployment, impending call to deployment, or rest and recuperation leave.

To learn more about PFL, view the [Paid Family Leave Fact Sheet](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de8714cf.pdf) or the [State Disability Insurance FAQs](/en/disability/Faqs/).

## Part-Time Worker – Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave

If you think you are eligible for benefits, file a claim if you:

* Work part-time.
* Have an intermittent work schedule.
* Have had your hours reduced.
* Have had your wages reduced.

After we receive your claim, we will determine if you are eligible. For more information, review [Part-time/Intermittent/Reduced Work Schedule](/en/disability/part-time_intermittent_reduced_work_schedule/).

## Reduced Wages – Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave

If you have a wage loss because you are unable to perform your normal or usual work and are placed in a position that pays less, you may be eligible for reduced or full DI or PFL benefits, depending on the amount of the wage loss.

## Workers' Compensation

**State Disability Insurance:** State Disability Insurance (SDI) benefits are paid for a temporary period of time only. SDI pays a weekly benefit when:

* Your injury or illness is not work-related.
* You are taking time off work to care for a seriously ill family member.
* You are taking time off to bond with a new child.

**Workers’ Compensation:** [Workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) helps you when your injury or illness is work related. Workers’ compensation may also pay medical bills, benefits for temporary or permanent disabilities, and retraining benefits.

If you are receiving benefits from your employer’s workers’ compensation carrier, usually you cannot receive DI or PFL benefits. However, DI or PFL benefits may be paid if your workers’ compensation claim is denied or your benefits are delayed.

**For More Information**

* [Workers’ Compensation and Disability Benefits](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/)
* Department of Industrial Relations, [Division of Workers’ Compensation](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/dwc_home_page.htm)

## Voluntary Plan – Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave

Eligible employers or a majority of their employees can apply for a [Voluntary Plan (VP)](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/). A VP pays DI and PFL benefits instead of using SDI coverage.

A VP must:

* Provide all the same benefits as SDI.
* Include at least one benefit that is better than SDI.
* Not cost employees more than SDI.

To file a VP claim, contact your personnel or benefits department.

## Self-Employed Disability Insurance Elective Coverage (DIEC)

[Disability Insurance Elective Coverage (DIEC)](/en/payroll_taxes/Disability_Insurance_Elective_Coverage/) is for employers and self-employed people who are not required to pay into [State Disability Insurance](/en/disability/About_the_State_Disability_Insurance_SDI_Program/), but want to be covered by [Disability Insurance (DI)](/en/disability/About_DI/) and [Paid Family Leave (PFL)](/en/disability/paid-family-leave/). DIEC is funded through quarterly premiums and can protect you against partial loss of income when you are unable to work.

DI or PFL provides benefits to eligible DIEC participants when they are unable to work and lose wages due to their own non-work-related illness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth or to care for a seriously ill family member, bond with a new child or participate in a qualifying event because of an eligible family member’s military deployment to a foreign country.

Workers’ Compensation and Disability Benefits https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/

## Know the Difference between Workers’ Compensation and State Disability Insurance

### What is Workers’ Compensation?

Workers’ compensation provides benefits for workers when their injury or illness arises out of or is caused by their work. Workers’ compensation may also pay medical bills and benefits for temporary or permanent disabilities.

If you are hurt at work, have a medical condition due to your occupation, or an existing work-related medical condition that has become worse, you can file a Disability Insurance (DI) claim.

Some examples of when you may receive DI benefits are:

* Your employer or employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier denies or delays workers’ compensation benefits.
* Your workers’ compensation weekly benefit amount is less than your DI weekly benefit amount, you may be eligible to receive the difference.

However, you usually cannot receive both workers’ compensation and DI benefits at the same time.

If SDI issues benefits while a workers’ compensation case is pending, a lien will be filed to recover those benefits when the workers’ compensation case is settled.

### What is Disability Insurance?

Disability Insurance is part of the [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/About_the_State_Disability_Insurance_SDI_Program/) program. It provides partial wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers who are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy. DI benefits are paid for a short period of time only.

### Not Sure What You Need?

If you are not sure that your injury or illness is work-related, a physician/practitioner may be able to determine the cause of your condition. If you think that a work-related disability occurred, you must report it to your employer. A physician/practitioner must submit a medical report to your employer’s workers’ compensation insurance company.

### Need to File an Appeal?

If you, your employer, or your employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier disagree on the workers’ compensation claim, contact the [Department of Industrial Relation, Division of Workers’ Compensation](http://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/dwc_home_page.htm) for information about the appeal process.

If you are disqualified from receiving DI or Paid Family Leave benefits, you have the [right to appeal](/en/disability/appeals/) any decision electronically or in writing within 30 days of the date your form was issued.

Nonindustrial Disability Insurance https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/nonindustrial/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Nonindustrial Disability Insurance (NDI) provides partial wage replacement to eligible State employees who have a loss of wages due to a non-work-related disability.

A disability is an illness or injury that prevents you from performing your regular work. The illness or injury can be physical or mental and can include elective surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical conditions.

**For Family Care Leave:** [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance - Family Care Leave (NDI-FCL)](/en/disability/nonindustrial/family-care-leave/) provides partial wage replacement to eligible state employees who are enrolled in the Annual Leave Program (ALP) and are excluded from bargaining or are an employee represented by a specific bargaining unit that has NDI-FCL language in their Memorandum of Understanding.

## Who is covered?

NDI benefits are available to:

* Permanent or probationary full-time or intermittent employees in “compensated employment” (in pay status and not separated by a formal leave of absence) who are members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) or the State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS).
* Employees who are excluded from collective bargaining and are full-time, permanent part-time, or intermittent officers or employees of the State Legislature, who are not civil service members.
* California State University employees appointed half-time or more for either one year of service or one academic year or more, are also covered.

**Note:** Permanent part-time and intermittent employees must have the equivalent of six monthly pay periods of service in the past 18 months. These periods must come immediately before the pay period the disability begins. These employees are eligible on a prorated basis.

No employee contributions, enrollment fees, or medical examinations are required to be covered.

### Eligibility Requirements

NDI covers excluded employees and rank-and-file employees in bargaining units 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, and 19. [CalHR](http://calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/non-industrial-disability-insurance.aspx) is responsible for contract administration.

For state employees in bargaining units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21, you will be covered by [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/).

To be eligible for NDI benefits, you must:

* Be a State employee who is not covered by SDI.
* Be unable to do your normal and usual work for at least eight days due to a non-work-related disability.
* Have lost wages because of your disability.

## File a Claim

### Filing Your Claim

Ask your employer’s personnel specialist or payroll officer for the *First Claim for Nonindustrial Disability Insurance (NDI)* (DE 8501) because they first must confirm you are enrolled in the Annual Leave Program and excluded from bargaining. Contact us at 1-866-758-9768 to get medical extension forms.

Your employer will complete and sign **Part A - Employer Information**.

You will complete and sign **Part B - Claim Statement of Employee**.

Things to Know About Your Claim Start Date

* The day you became unable to work due to your disability is the **date your disability begins**.
* You can file your claim after the first day your disability begins.
* If you have any questions about your claim start date, **before** filing your claim contact us at 1-866-758-9768 .
* Your claim may have a 7 or 10 day waiting period.  Check with your Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or personnel specialist for additional details about your waiting period.

## Manage Your Claim

### Receiving Benefits

Your employer issues benefit payments of up to $250 per week for 26 weeks (182 days) with a waiting period of 7 or 10 days. The benefit amount and rules about using leave credits vary based on your employment status and bargaining unit.

If you participate in the California’s annual leave program, you are eligible to receive Enhanced NDI (ENDI) benefits of 50% of your gross pay. This can be supplemented with leave credits at 75% or 100%.

State and federal taxes will be withheld from NDI benefits. Voluntary deductions, such as health insurance premiums, credit union loans, savings accounts, bonds, and parking fees, will automatically be deducted from NDI benefits unless you cancel. If you continue to deduct your health insurance premium, your employer’s contribution will also continue.

### Get a Medical Certification

Medical certifications are required for disability and caregiver claims to receive NDI or NDI-FCL benefits.

Unlike SDI, NDI is not an automated program. Paper forms still need to be filled out to begin or extend the medical portion of a claim.

Talk to your licensed health professional about their process for submitting a medical certification (not all medical offices follow the same steps or process).

**Note:** Your claim is not complete until your licensed health professional completes a medical certification.

You can get medical extension forms by contacting us at 1-866-758-9768.

More than 18 million California workers are covered by the California State Disability Insurance (SDI) program. SDI is a partial wage-replacement insurance plan for eligible California workers. SDI is a deduction from employees’ wages. This is usually shown as “CASDI” on your paystub.

If you are covered by SDI, the following benefits are available to you:

## Disability Insurance

Disability Insurance (DI) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers who have a loss of wages when they are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy.

DI does not provide job protection, only monetary benefits; however, your job may be protected through other federal or state laws such as the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) or the [California Family Rights Act (CFRA)](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/).

Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides benefits to people who need to take time off work to:

* Bond with a new child entering the family through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.
* Participate in a qualifying event resulting from an eligible family member’s military deployment to a foreign country.

## SDI for State Employees

State employees are divided into 21 bargaining units. SDI covers employees in bargaining units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21.  
SDI pays part of an employee’s wages if they have to stop working due to any of the following:

* A non-work-related illness or injury.
* A pregnancy or to bond with a new child entering the family through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.
* To care for a seriously ill child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner.

Disability Insurance Claim Process https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/DI_Claim_Process/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Disability Insurance (DI) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers.

## Follow These Steps

### 1. Review Your Eligibility

You must be eligible to receive DI benefits. Some requirements are:

* You aren't able to do your regular work for at least eight consecutive days.
* You've lost wages because of your disability.
* You're employed or actively looking for work at the time your disability began.
* You're being treated by a licensed health professional.

View the complete list of [eligibility requirements](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_DI_Benefits/).

**Note:** Citizenship and immigration status do not affect eligibility.

You may also be interested in visiting:

* [Calculating DI Benefit Payment Amounts](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/)
* [Integration of Benefits](/en/disability/integration-coordination/)
* [Part Time Intermittent Reduced Work Schedule](/en/disability/part-time_intermittent_reduced_work_schedule/)
* [Voluntary Plan](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/)
* [Self-Employed – Eligibility for Disability Insurance Elective Coverage](/en/disability/Self-Employed_Eligibility/)

### 2. File Your Claim

You have two [options to file for DI benefits](/en/disability/options_to_file_for_di_benefits/). You can file your claim using [SDI Online](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_in_sdi_online/) (recommended) or by submitting the *Claim for Disability Insurance (DI) Benefits* (DE 2501) by mail.

For more information, review:

* [How to File a Disability Insurance Claim in SDI Online](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_in_sdi_online/)
* [How to File a Disability Insurance Claim by Mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/)

**Note:** The EDD will not process your claim until your application is properly completed.

#### Your Claim Start Date

To be eligible for benefits, you must be losing wages because your disability is preventing your regular work. This means you're not working or you're working reduced hours.

The first day you can't do your regular work because of your disability is **the date your disability begins**. You **may not** change the start date of your claim or adjust your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) after establishing a valid claim. A valid claim means there are still wages in your base period. 

**Important:** The base claim period for a pregnancy disability claim and the resulting weekly benefit amount is the same one that will be used for the following Paid Family Leave bonding claim for new mothers.

If you have any questions about your claim start date, contact DI at 1-800-480-3287 **before** filing your claim.

#### When to File Your Claim

You can file your claim on the first day of your disability, but to avoid creating delays on your claim, losing benefits, or having your claim disqualified, you should file your claim:

* No earlier than nine days after your disability begins.
* No later than 49 days after your disability begins.

**Note:** If you have a good reason for filing late, include a letter to explain your reasons when you file your claim so the claims analyst can review your information to make a determination.

Choose your [payment option](/en/about_edd/your-benefit-payment-options/) when you file your claim:

* Direct deposit (SDI Online claims only)
* Debit card
* Check

### 3. Get a Medical Certification

Your licensed health professional must certify to your disability by completing and submitting the medical certification using either SDI Online or the DE 2501 *Part B – Physician/Practitioner’s Certificate* of the paper claim form. It is **your responsibility** to have your licensed health professional complete and sign the certification and submit it to us within 49 days from the date your disability begins so you don't lose benefits or have your claim disqualified.

* A nurse practitioner may certify to a disability within their scope of practice; however, they must perform a physical examination and collaborate with a physician or surgeon.
* A licensed midwife, nurse-midwife, or nurse practitioner may complete the medical certification for disabilities related to normal pregnancy or childbirth.
* If you are under the care of an accredited religious practitioner, you can download and print the [*Claim for Disability Insurance Benefits-Religious Practitioner’s Certificate* (DE 2502) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de2502.pdf) for them to complete.

**Note:** Your claim is not complete until your licensed health professional completes a medical certification.

### 4. Eligibility Status Determined

Once we receive your completed claim application, we will determine your eligibility. You can expect this process to take up to 14 days.

**Note:** Processing time may vary depending upon the claim. If your claim is incomplete or requires additional information, confirming eligibility can be delayed.

During this time, we will send you a *Notice of Computation* (DE 429D) to inform you of your potential weekly benefit amount based on the wages you earned in your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/).  
  
**Note:** Receiving this notice does not confirm your eligibility to receive DI benefits.

**Eligible for Benefits**  
If you are eligible for benefits, we will send you an *Electronic Benefit Payment Notification* (DE 2500E) with information about your first benefit payment.

Before you receive benefits, you must serve an unpaid seven-day waiting period (calendar days). The first payable day is the eighth day of the claim.

Review the [DI Benefits and Payments FAQs](/en/disability/faqs-benefits-payments/) for more information.

### If We Can't Determine Your Eligibility

We'll contact you by phone or mail for more information. We may also need to contact your employer or licensed health professional.

**Not Eligible for Benefits**  
If you are not eligible, we will send you a *Notice of Determination* (DE 2517) and an *Appeal Form* (DE 1000A). You have the right to [appeal](/en/disability/appeals/) any decision by completing the DE 1000A electronically or by mail within 30 days of the date your form was issued.

### 5. Continue or Stop Your Benefits

### Continue Benefits

**If You’re Receiving Automatic Payments**  
If you are on automatic payment, we will send you a *Disability Claim Continuing Eligibility Certification* (DE 2593) after 10 weeks of payment. You must return this form to us to certify that your disability continues. If you do not return the DE 2593, your benefits will stop.

**If You’re Not Receiving Automatic Payments**  
If you are not on automatic payment, we will send you a *Claim for Continued Disability Benefits* (DE 2500A) every two weeks to certify that your disability continues. If you do not return the DE 2500A, your benefits will stop.

The quickest way to submit the DE 2593 or DE 2500A is through [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).

**Extend Your Benefit Period If You Have Not Recovered**  
You may be eligible to receive benefits through the return-to-work or recovery date your physician/practitioner provides us. With your final payment, we will mail you a *Physician/Practitioner’s Supplementary Certificate* (DE 2525XX).

If you have not fully recovered and want to continue benefits, you must have your physician/practitioner complete the DE 2525XX and return the form to us to certify your continuing disability. Your physician/practitioner may complete and submit the DE 2525XX using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) or by [mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/).

### Discontinue Benefits

**Stop Benefits If You Have Recovered or Returned to Work**  
If you recover or return to work on the date your physician/practitioner provided to us, no further action is required to stop your claim.

If you have been approved to go back to work **before** the physician/practitioner’s estimated date of recovery, complete one of the following:

* The Disability Status section of the *Claim for Continued Disability Benefits* (DE 2500A).
* The Recovery or Return to Work Certification portion of the *Notice of Automatic Payment* (DE 2587).
* Question 1 of the *Disability Claim Continuing Eligibility Questionnaire* (DE 2593).
* Use the **Claim Update** function on [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).

If you previously recovered or returned to work and became ill or injured again, immediately file a new claim form (DE 2501) and report the dates you worked.

Roles of Licensed Health Professionals in State Disability Insurance https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/Physicians-Practitioners/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

## Certify and Manage Patient Claims

If your patient or their caregiver are eligible for State Disability Insurance (SDI), they may be covered by one of two benefits: Disability Insurance (DI) or Paid Family Leave (PFL).

The quality, accuracy, and timeliness of your medical certifications are important to the processing of their DI or PFL claim.

### Who Can Certify

We review claims to ensure that all eligibility requirements are met; this includes verification of your health professional’s license which must be active and in good standing.

The following licensed health professionals can certify claims:

* Licensed medical or osteopathic physician/practitioners
* Authorized medical officer of a U.S. Government facility
* Chiropractor
* Podiatrist
* Optometrist
* Dentist
* Psychologist
* Nurse practitioner or physician assistant
* Licensed midwife, nurse-midwife, or nurse practitioner for pregnancy, childbirth, or postpartum conditions consistent with the scope of their professional licensing.
* Accredited religious practitioner

**Important:** Effective January 1, 2024, [Senate Bill 667](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB667) changes the scope of nurse midwife certification authorization.

### How to Certify Claims

If your patient or their caregiver asks you for a medical certification for their SDI claim, you can fill out and submit the form using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/). For more information, visit the [Certify and Manage Claims - Basics for Licensed Health Professionals](/en/disability/Basics_for_Physicians-Practitioners/) page.

**Note:** You will need to complete an identity and medical license verification through ID.me to register an account and use SDI Online.

## Independent Medical Examiner Information

The State Disability Insurance (SDI) program has a panel of Independent Medical Examiners. These are licensed health professionals responsible for the supplemental examinations that verify a disability status by providing a second medical opinion when the original certification is in question. Examinations by the SDI program follow the guidelines listed in [Section 2627(c)-1(b) of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I06F3D3C0D4B711DE8879F88E8B0DAAAE&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29#IC10399C8AA3641A2B98947DD7AC9FD55).

For example, SDI may request an examination if a licensed health professional lists the claimant’s disability as lasting longer than what is considered normal for the diagnosis but doesn’t provide a medically justified reason.

Independent medical examinations assist SDI in preserving the Disability Fund for the benefit of workers who are insured through SDI.

### How to Become an Independent Medical Examiner

If you are a licensed health professional and would like to become an Independent Medical Examiner, contact us by emailing [DIBMedical@edd.ca.gov](mailto:DIBMedical@edd.ca.gov) or at the mailing address below. Please provide us with a contact phone number, email, and mailing address. We will contact you and provide you with the appropriate forms to complete.

Nonindustrial Disability Insurance-Family Care Leave https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/nonindustrial/family-care-leave/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

## Program Overview

Nonindustrial Disability Insurance-Family Care Leave (NDI-FCL) provides partial wage replacement for up to six weeks within any 12-month period to:

* Care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner).
* Bond with a new child entering the family through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.
* Participate in a qualifying event because of a family member’s (spouse, registered domestic partner, parent, or child) military deployment to a foreign country.

## Who is covered?

NDI-FCL covers excluded, exempt, supervisory, managerial, or confidential employees and specific bargaining units. [CalHR](http://calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/non-industrial-disability-insurance.aspx) is responsible for contract administration.

Some state employees are not covered by NDI-FCL but are covered by State Disability Insurance (SDI) which includes Paid Family Leave (PFL) through a negotiated agreement. State employees in bargaining units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21, are covered by SDI PFL. For information about SDI, visit [About the State Disability Insurance Program](/en/disability/About_the_State_Disability_Insurance_SDI_Program/). For specific information about PFL visit [Paid Family Leave](/en/disability/paid-family-leave/).

NDI-FCL benefits are available to:

* Permanent or probationary full-time or intermittent employees who are members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) or the State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and in “compensated employment” (meaning you are in pay status and not separated by a formal leave of absence).
* Employees who are excluded from collective bargaining and are full-time, permanent part-time, or intermittent officers or employees of the State Legislature, who are not civil service members.
* California State University employees appointed half-time or more for either one year of service or one academic year or more, are also covered.
* Employees not represented by a bargaining unit or represented by a specific bargaining unit that has Family Care Leave language in their Memorandum of Understanding (Contact your personnel specialist for more details.)

## Eligibility

To be eligible for NDI-FCL, you must:

* Be a state employee who is eligible for NDI-FCL and not covered by SDI PFL. Non leave earning exempt employees are not eligible.
* Be enrolled in the Annual Leave Program (ALP)
* Be a full-time employee; or,
* Be a part-time employee with six months of service within the last 18 months; or,
* Be an intermittent employee with a total of 960 hours of employment.
* Be unable to do your normal or usual work because you must take family leave for care, bonding, or a military assist event.

## NDI-FCL Wages and Payment Process

We will determine your eligibility for NDI-FCL and approve benefit payments. We will send you a *Notice of Eligibility for Nonindustrial Disability Insurance or Nonindustrial Disability Insurance - Family Care Leave* *(NDI-FCL)* (DE 8500). We will also send an *Authorization to Pay Nonindustrial Disability Insurance or Nonindustrial Disability Insurance - Family Care Leave**(NDI-FCL)* (DE 8500A) to your employer. These notices provide the time period you are approved for a NDI-FCL claim.

Once your employer’s personnel office receives the DE 8500A, they must authorize and request the [State Controller](https://www.sco.ca.gov/) or paying agent to issue benefit payments to you.

Benefits are paid based on your employer’s payment schedule. Once we authorize your benefits, questions concerning your NDI-FCL benefits, including payment status, weekly rates, payment amounts, and deductions should be directed to your attendance clerk or personnel office.

You are not required to serve a waiting period before benefits are paid.

* NDI-FCL provides wages for up to 6 weeks (42 days) per claim in a 12-month period.
* You will receive 50% of your gross monthly salary.
* You can use leave credits to supplement your salary at 75% or 100%.

### Retirement or Service Credit

* State employer contributions to your retirement account will not be made while you are receiving NDI-FCL.
* You will not earn service credit from the [California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS)](https://www.calpers.ca.gov/) or California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) for the 50% NDI-FCL wages. All service credit is earned for time worked or supplemented with the leave you earn.

### Benefit Payment Exceptions

Benefits are not payable for any day that you:

* Are eligible for temporary [workers’ compensation benefits](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) or [Industrial Disability Leave](https://www.dgs.ca.gov/OHR/Resources/Page-Content/Office-of-Human-Resources-Resources-List-Folder/Personnel-Operations-Manual/Industrial-Disability-Leave).
* Receive full wages in the form of sick leave, vacation, compensatory time off, or catastrophic leave.
* Are paid unemployment benefits.
* Are separated or retired from state service.

Voluntary Plan https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

California employers or a majority of employees can apply to the EDD for approval to provide a plan for short-term disability insurance and family leave, known as a Voluntary Plan (VP), instead of [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/) coverage. Both SDI and VP provide short-term wage replacement disability insurance and family leave benefits.

* [## Getting Started](#pane-3ca178e5-10e0-4380-8233-9fab6f50f9a9)
* [## Manage Claims](#pane-2150c4e5-033a-45fa-a0c0-3141f36780f8)
* [## Tax Reporting](#pane-a41661ec-f32f-4439-8a83-09d3704cfeef)

## Getting Started

In order to offer VP, you must first apply and get approval from the EDD. For information on how to apply, visit [Become a Voluntary Plan Employer](/en/disability/Pre-Requisites_for_Becoming_a_Voluntary_Plan_Employer/).

A VP must:

* Offer the same benefits to employees as SDI.
* Provides at least one benefit that is better than SDI.
* Not cost employees more than SDI.
* Be updated to match any increase in benefits that SDI implements from legislation or approved regulation.

## Manage Claims

You can process VP claims conveniently and securely using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) to submit State Award Request (SAR). To set up your online account, visit [Manage Your Voluntary Plan](/en/disability/VP_Online_Services/).

## Tax Reporting

You do not need to send in [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/) contributions for employees covered under a Voluntary Plan (VP). But, you must send SDI contributions for employees with SDI coverage. Any contributions that are required from VP employees must be secured in a trust fund. For any employees who opt-out, you (employer) must send their SDI contributions to the EDD Tax Branch. To learn how to file online, visit [Voluntary Plan Tax Reporting](/en/disability/Tax_Reporting_on_VP_Accounts/).

## Contact the Voluntary Plan Group

For assistance, you can contact the Voluntary Plan Group by phone, email, or mail:

* Email: [VPProgram@edd.ca.gov](mailto:VPProgram@edd.ca.gov)

## Benefit Overpayment Services

A benefit overpayment is when you collect unemployment, disability, or Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits you are not eligible to receive. It is important to repay overpayments to avoid collection and legal action.

**Note:** You can repay your overpayment by check before receiving the *Benefit Overpayment Collection Notice*. Review your *Notice of Overpayment* for instructions.

**Important:** You cannot repay your overpayment online until you receive a *Benefit Overpayment Collection Notice* (DE 8344JUDR) with your Claimant ID and Letter ID. We will mail you the *Benefit Overpayment Collection Notice* 30 days after we mail the *Notice of Overpayment* or the *Notice of Denial of Benefits and Overpayment*, or when an appeal is denied.

If you do not enroll in Benefit Overpayment Services, you can make a one-time payment online but remember you will still need *Benefit Overpayment Collection Notice* (DE 8344JUDR) with your Claimant ID and Letter ID.

Contact the Benefit Overpayment Collection Section at 1-800-676-5737 during normal business hours of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific time). We can help you with:

* Questions about your overpayment.
* Updating your address or phone number.

# Conditions of Use Policy

Thank you for visiting the State of California’s website and reviewing our Use Policy. You should also be aware that the State has a [Privacy Policy](/en/about_edd/privacy_policy/), also available on this website. The State wants you to know about the collection, use, security, and access to information that may be obtained through use of the State’s web portal. By visiting this website, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Notice. This Notice covers the topics listed below.

Please note that this Use Policy is subject to change without notice, and that it reflects the State’s current business practices. This Use policy is dated December 7, 2000.

Also note that each department within the State may have additional privacy and use policies specific to the mission and needs of their work. Be sure to review those policies as you access additional sites within the State.

## [Personal Information and Choice](#collapse-96a999ac-fa09-4092-adb8-f3a2df449907)

"Personal information" is information about a natural person that identifies or describes an individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and medical or employment history, readily identifiable to that specific individual. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information; however, it is considered "electronically collected personal information."

According to Government Code § 11015.5., "electronically collected personal information" means any information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual user, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, medical or employment history, password, electronic mail address, and information that reveals any network location or identity, but excludes any information manually submitted to a State agency by a user, whether electronically or in written form, and information on or relating to individuals who are users, serving in a business capacity, including, but not limited to, business owners, officers, or principals of that business.

"Electronically collected personal information" that we automatically collect includes your domain name or Internet Protocol address, and statistical information about which web pages you visit. If you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for specific information (i.e., completing a request for assistance, personalizing the content of the website, sending an email, or participating in a survey) more detailed data will be collected. If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the website.

If any type of personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by the user, State law, including the Information Practices Act of 1977, Government Code Section 11015.5., and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information may be a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by federal or State law.

Additionally, departments and agencies of the State of California under the authority of the Governor are required to adhere to the Privacy Policy which is also accessible on this website.

## [A Special Note about Children](#collapse-ebe09900-d1d9-4ebd-ac67-cce5d81eabf1)

Children are not eligible to use services that require submission of personal information, and we require that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. This includes submitting personal information to the State as part of a user profile or personalization profile. If you are a minor, you can use these services only if used together with your parents or guardians. If you are a minor, you should seek guidance from your parents.

If the State decides to begin collecting personal information from children, it will notify parents that it is being requested, disclose the reasons for collecting it, and disclose our intended use of it. The State will seek parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information. If it does collect it, parents may request information on the type of data being collected, view their child’s information, and, if they choose, prohibit the State from making further use of their child’s information. The State will not provide personal information about children to third parties.

## [Information Collected and How It Is Used](#collapse-2604f6bf-f717-4c4b-8737-0d620d781710)

We do collect personal information directly from individuals who volunteer to use some of our services. Collection of this information is required to deliver the specific services, but use of these services is voluntary.

If you do nothing during your visit to the website but browse or download information, we automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

1. The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used, but not the email address. The Internet Protocol Address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you and generate statistics used in the management of this site;
2. The type of browser and operating system you used;
3. The date and time you visited this site;
4. The web pages or services you accessed at this site;
5. The website you visited prior to coming to this website;
6. The website you visit as you leave this website; and
7. If you downloaded a form, the form that was downloaded.

The information we automatically collect or store is used to improve the content of our web services and to help us understand how people are using our services. This information does not identify you personally and is used for gathering website statistics. The information we automatically collect and store in our logs about your visit helps us to analyze our website to continually improve the value of the materials available. Our website logs do not identify a visitor by personal information, and we make no attempt to link other websites with the individuals that browse the State’s website.

Government Code § 11015.5.(a)(6) prohibits all state agencies from distributing or selling any electronically collected personal information, as defined above, about users to any third party without the permission of the user. The State does not sell any "electronically collected personal information." Any distribution of "electronically collected personal information" will be solely for the purposes for which it was provided to us.

The State may provide or distribute certain lists and statistical reports of regulatory information as provided by law, but no personal information is sold or distributed, and all relevant legal protections still apply to the State’s websites.

## [What Happens To Information You Submit To Us?](#collapse-f9d8683b-3762-4764-a7b5-4e9bfbbf8b3d)

If you choose to submit information to us, the information will be transmitted through secure lines to our departmental database. Any private information will only be used for the purposes for which it was provided and will not be shared with another entity except as prescribed by law. Please see our Privacy Policy for additional information.

## [Use of Internet Request for Assistance Form Information](#collapse-02e13d9b-f916-49f6-aba6-e3dc9276dff7)

Any information you provide to us will only be shared with entities involved in your case as necessary. Information you provide may be included with other consumers’ information to be used for statistical reporting, trending data, and/or investigative actions. For example, we may need to retain information that becomes part of an enforcement action or consumer complaint case for a period of time after the closing date of the case.

If you provide us with information regarding an issue that does not fall within our regulatory jurisdiction, we may refer your information to the appropriate local, State, or federal agency on your behalf.

## [Surveys](#collapse-b54ceb11-90fe-4339-b755-d92fa840a3f0)

If during your visit to the State’s website you participate in a survey or send an email, the following additional information will be collected:

1. The email address and contents of the email; and
2. Information volunteered in response to the survey.

The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.

The information is retained in accordance with Government Code § 11015.5.

## [If You Send Us Email](#collapse-62e911f0-e4d0-4e20-b9a9-22aa117dbde3)

You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in email with a comment or question. We use the information to improve our service to you or to respond to your request. Sometimes we forward your email to other State employees who may be better able to help you, and this staff may be employed by a different agency within the State.
