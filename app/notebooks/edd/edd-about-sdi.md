How to File a Disability Insurance Claim by Mail https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

If you think you're [eligible for benefits](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_DI_Benefits/), file a claim to apply. You can file a claim by mail or even faster with [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).

Note: If any of the following apply, you should file a paper claim form instead of filing online:

* You do not have a valid California driver license or ID.
* You do not have a valid SSN.
* You have a name that does not fit the space in the online form.
* You had a recent name change.
* You received an error code you cannot resolve or have any other difficulty filing an application online.

Follow these steps to file a Disability Insurance (DI) claim by mail.

## Step 1: Get Your Claim Form

You can get a paper *Claim for Disability Insurance (DI) Benefits* (DE 2501) form by:

* Ordering a [form online](https://forms.edd.ca.gov/forms) to have it mailed to you.
* Getting the form from your licensed health professional or employer.
* Visiting an [SDI Office](https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/Contact_SDI/).
* Calling 1-800-480-3287 and selecting DI Information option 3 to request a paper form by mail.

**Note**: Allow up to ten days to receive this form.

## Step 2: Gather Required Information

You **must**provide the following information to file a DI claim:

* First and last name.
* Most current employer’s business name, phone number, and mailing address (as stated on your W-2 or paystub).
* Last date you worked your normal or usual duties (or the date you began working less than full or modified duty).

You must also give the following information **only**if it applies to you:

* Any wages you received or expect to receive from your employer (sick leave, paid time off (PTO), vacation pay, annual leave, and wages earned after you stopped working).
* Any [workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) claim information.
* If you receive in-patient treatment at an alcohol recovery home or drug-free rehabilitation facility, provide the name, address, and phone number of the home or facility.

Note: The facility must be licensed and certified by the state in which the facility is located.

## Step 3: Complete Part A: Claimant’s Statement (DE 2501)

You are responsible for filling out Part A - Claimant’s Statement of the DE 2501 form. Write clearly in the spaces provided. Fill out the form completely using black ink only, and sign the form. An incomplete form could delay processing.

## Step 4: Get Your Licensed Health Professional to Complete Part B: Medical Certification

You must get a licensed health professional certification for your disability. Once you have filled out Part A of the DE 2501 form, contact your licensed health professional about completing, signing, and submitting your medical certification (Part B – Physician/professional’s Certificate).

Talk to your licensed health professional about their process for submitting a DI claim (not all of them follow the same process). Your licensed health professional must submit the certification no later than 49 days after your disability begins or you may lose benefits.

* If your licensed health professional wants to submit the medical certification using SDI Online, allow 14 calendar days for us to receive and process your claim.
* After your claim has been received, your licensed health professional can find your claim in [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).

## Step 5: Mail in Your Completed DI Claim Form (DE 2501)

There are two parts to completing this form. For your claim to be considered complete, both parts of the DE 2501 form need to be submitted:

* Part A - Claimant’s Statement
* Part B - Physician/professional’s Medical Certificate (a licensed health professional can submit this part)

You can file your claim on the first day of your disability, but to avoid creating delays on your claim, losing benefits, or having your claim disqualified, you should file your claim:

* No earlier than nine days after your disability begins.
* No later than 49 days after your disability begins

If you have a good reason for filing late, please provide that explanation when you file your claim so the claims analyst can review your information to make a determination.

Your claim will not be processed until we receive both part A and part B.

Use the pre-addressed envelope to mail to:

State of California  
Employment Development Department  
PO Box 989777  
West Sacramento, CA 95798-9777

Do not submit the same claim more than once. This will delay your claim.

**Note:** Your employer will be notified that you have submitted a DI claim. However, medical information is confidential and will not be shared with your employer.

For more information on how to file a DI claim using SDI Online, view our [Claimant Tutorials](/en/disability/SDI_Online_Tutorials/) and an outline on the [Disability Insurance Claim Process](/en/disability/DI_Claim_Process/).

About the State Disability Insurance Program https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/About_the_State_Disability_Insurance_SDI_Program

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

More than 18 million California workers are covered by the California State Disability Insurance (SDI) program. SDI is a partial wage-replacement insurance plan for eligible California workers. SDI is a deduction from employees’ wages. This is usually shown as “CASDI” on your paystub.

If you are covered by SDI, the following benefits are available to you:

## Disability Insurance

Disability Insurance (DI) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers who have a loss of wages when they are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy.

DI does not provide job protection, only monetary benefits; however, your job may be protected through other federal or state laws such as the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) or the [California Family Rights Act (CFRA)](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/).

If you think you’re eligible for disability benefits, you’ll want to file a claim to apply.

## Paid Family Leave

Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides benefits to people who need to take time off work to:

* Care for a seriously ill child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner.
* Bond with a new child entering the family through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.
* Participate in a qualifying event resulting from an eligible family member’s military deployment to a foreign country.

## SDI for State Employees

State employees are divided into 21 bargaining units. SDI covers employees in bargaining units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21.  
SDI pays part of an employee’s wages if they have to stop working due to any of the following:

* A non-work-related illness or injury.
* A pregnancy or to bond with a new child entering the family through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.
* To care for a seriously ill child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner.

Disability Insurance Eligibility Requirements https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_DI_Benefits/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

## Am I Eligible for Disability Insurance Benefits?

Disability Insurance (DI) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers.

You may be eligible for DI if you are unable to work and are losing wages because of your own non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy.

### Requirements to File a Claim

In order to be eligible for DI benefits, you must:

* Be unable to do your regular or customary work for at least eight days.
* Have lost wages because of your disability.
* Be employed or actively looking for work at the time your disability begins.
* Have earned at least $300 from which State Disability Insurance (SDI) deductions were withheld during your base period. Learn more with [Calculating Benefit Payment Amounts](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/).
* Be under the care and treatment of a licensed physician/practitioner or accredited religious practitioner within the first eight days of your disability. The date your claim begins can be adjusted if it does not meet this requirement. You must remain under care and treatment to continue receiving benefits.

Complete and submit your *Claim for Disability Insurance (DI) Benefits*(DE 2501) on time. You can file your claim on the first day of your disability, but to avoid creating delays on your claim, losing benefits, or having your claim disqualified, you should file your claim:

* No earlier than nine days after your disability begins.
* No later than 49 days after your disability begins.

If you have a good reason for filing late, please provide that explanation when you file your claim so the claims analyst can review your information to make a determination.

Have your physician/practitioner complete the medical certification portion of your disability claim.

* A nurse practitioner may certify to a disability within their scope of practice.
* A licensed midwife, nurse-midwife, or nurse practitioner may complete the medical certification for disabilities related to normal pregnancy or childbirth.
* If you are under the care of an accredited religious practitioner, you may download and print the [*Claim for Disability Insurance Benefits-Religious Practitioner’s Certificate* (DE 2502) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de2502.pdf).

**A note for misclassified workers**: If you think your employer has misclassified you as an independent contractor, you should still apply for DI and let us decide your eligibility.

#### Additional Information

* Citizenship and immigration status do not affect eligibility.
* Your employer will be notified that you have submitted a DI claim. However, your medical information is confidential and will not be shared with your employer.
* School employees are not eligible for DI benefits when receiving full wages or for school break periods unless they normally work another job during the school break for extra income. Visit [Disability Insurance – Eligibility FAQs](/en/disability/FAQ_DI_Eligibility/) or [Contact DI](/en/disability/Contact_SDI/) for more information.

**Note:** An independent medical examination to determine your initial or continuing eligibility may be required.

About Disability Insurance https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/About_DI/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Disability Insurance (DI) is a part of the [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/About_the_State_Disability_Insurance_SDI_Program/) program. It provides partial wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers who are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy. SDI contributions are paid by California workers through employee payroll deductions.

DI does not provide job protection, only monetary benefits; however, your job may be protected through other federal or state laws such as the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) or the [California Family Rights Act (CFRA)](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I6A8A63F05A0A11EC8227000D3A7C4BC3&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)).

## Disability Insurance

Disability is an illness or injury, either physical or mental, which prevents you from performing your regular and customary work. Disability also includes elective surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical conditions.

Although work-related disabilities are covered by workers’ compensation laws, DI benefits may also be paid for work-related illness or injuries under certain circumstances. You can learn more about the difference between [workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) and DI.

## Disability Insurance Benefit Payments

If you are eligible, you can receive about 60 to 70 percent (depending on income) of wages earned 5 to 18 months before your claim start date. You can be paid benefits for a maximum of 52 weeks. For more information, review [Calculating Disability Benefit Payment Amounts](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/).

To receive benefits, you must:

* File a claim for DI benefits using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) or [by mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/).
* Complete a seven-day, unpaid waiting period.
* Have earned at least $300 in wages that are subject to SDI deductions (“CASDI” on your paystubs) during the 12-month [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) of your claim.
* Have your physician/practitioner certify to your disability by completing the Physician/Practitioner Certification.
* Choose your payment option when you file your claim:
	+ Direct Deposit (SDI Online claims only)
	+ Debit card
	+ Check

To learn more, review the following:

* [Disability Insurance - Overview](/en/disability/disability_insurance/)

Your pregnancy claim begins when you have a loss of wages and your physician/practitioner confirms that you are unable to do your normal or usual job duties.

The usual disability period for a normal pregnancy is up to four weeks before the expected delivery date and up to six weeks (for normal delivery) or eight weeks (for Cesarean section) after the actual delivery. However, your physician/practitioner may certify to a longer disability period prior to or after delivery if there are medical complications and if you are unable to perform your normal or usual job duties.

Your post-partum benefits are limited to the period that you are actually unable to do your normal or usual work.

**Note:** New mothers transitioning from a DI-related pregnancy claim to PFL-related bonding should remember that when you have recovered from delivering your baby, a *Claim for Paid Family Leave (PFL) Benefits – New Mother* (DE 2501FP) will be automatically mailed to you in a separate envelope at the same time your final DI payment is issued.

## Paid Family Leave Bonding Claim

Paid Family Leave (PFL) Bonding provides benefits to eligible workers who need to take time off work to bond with a new child entering the family by birth, adoption, or foster care placement.

## Paid Family Leave Care Claim

Paid Family Leave (PFL) Care provides benefits to [eligible](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_PFL_Benefits/) workers who need to take time off work to care for a seriously ill:

* Child
* Parent
* Parent-in-law
* Grandparent
* Grandchild
* Sibling
* Spouse or registered domestic partner

PFL defines a serious health condition as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition of a patient that requires:

* At-home care or in-patient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility.
* Continuing treatment by a physician or health care practitioner.

Unless there are complications, the following are examples of conditions that do not qualify as a serious condition for PFL.

* [State Disability Insurance (SDI) FAQs](/en/disability/Faqs/)

## Paid Family Leave Military Assist Claim

PFL now offers benefits to California workers who take time off work to participate in a qualifying event because of an eligible family member’s (spouse, registered domestic partner, parent, or child) military deployment to a foreign country.

A qualifying event is any military event or an essential need resulting from the family member’s call to deployment, impending call to deployment, or rest and recuperation leave.

To learn more about PFL, view the [Paid Family Leave Fact Sheet](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de8714cf.pdf) or the [State Disability Insurance FAQs](/en/disability/Faqs/).

## Part-Time Worker – Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave

If you think you are eligible for benefits, file a claim if you:

* Work part-time.
* Have an intermittent work schedule.
* Have had your hours reduced.
* Have had your wages reduced.

After we receive your claim, we will determine if you are eligible. For more information, review [Part-time/Intermittent/Reduced Work Schedule](/en/disability/part-time_intermittent_reduced_work_schedule/).

## Reduced Wages – Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave

If you have a wage loss because you are unable to perform your normal or usual work and are placed in a position that pays less, you may be eligible for reduced or full DI or PFL benefits, depending on the amount of the wage loss.

## Workers' Compensation

**State Disability Insurance:** State Disability Insurance (SDI) benefits are paid for a temporary period of time only. SDI pays a weekly benefit when:

* Your injury or illness is not work-related.
* You are taking time off work to care for a seriously ill family member.
* You are taking time off to bond with a new child.

**Workers’ Compensation:** [Workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) helps you when your injury or illness is work related. Workers’ compensation may also pay medical bills, benefits for temporary or permanent disabilities, and retraining benefits.

If you are receiving benefits from your employer’s workers’ compensation carrier, usually you cannot receive DI or PFL benefits. However, DI or PFL benefits may be paid if your workers’ compensation claim is denied or your benefits are delayed.

* [Workers’ Compensation and Disability Benefits](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/)
* Department of Industrial Relations, [Division of Workers’ Compensation](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/dwc_home_page.htm)

## Voluntary Plan – Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave

Eligible employers or a majority of their employees can apply for a [Voluntary Plan (VP)](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/). A VP pays DI and PFL benefits instead of using SDI coverage.

A VP must:

* Provide all the same benefits as SDI.
* Include at least one benefit that is better than SDI.
* Not cost employees more than SDI.

To file a VP claim, contact your personnel or benefits department.

## Self-Employed Disability Insurance Elective Coverage (DIEC)

[Disability Insurance Elective Coverage (DIEC)](/en/payroll_taxes/Disability_Insurance_Elective_Coverage/) is for employers and self-employed people who are not required to pay into [State Disability Insurance](/en/disability/About_the_State_Disability_Insurance_SDI_Program/), but want to be covered by [Disability Insurance (DI)](/en/disability/About_DI/) and [Paid Family Leave (PFL)](/en/disability/paid-family-leave/). DIEC is funded through quarterly premiums and can protect you against partial loss of income when you are unable to work.

DI or PFL provides benefits to eligible DIEC participants when they are unable to work and lose wages due to their own non-work-related illness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth or to care for a seriously ill family member, bond with a new child or participate in a qualifying event because of an eligible family member’s military deployment to a foreign country.

Workers’ Compensation and Disability Benefits https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

## Know the Difference between Workers’ Compensation and State Disability Insurance

### What is Workers’ Compensation?

Workers’ compensation provides benefits for workers when their injury or illness arises out of or is caused by their work. Workers’ compensation may also pay medical bills and benefits for temporary or permanent disabilities.

If you are hurt at work, have a medical condition due to your occupation, or an existing work-related medical condition that has become worse, you can file a Disability Insurance (DI) claim.

Some examples of when you may receive DI benefits are:

* Your employer or employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier denies or delays workers’ compensation benefits.
* Your workers’ compensation weekly benefit amount is less than your DI weekly benefit amount, you may be eligible to receive the difference.

However, you usually cannot receive both workers’ compensation and DI benefits at the same time.

If SDI issues benefits while a workers’ compensation case is pending, a lien will be filed to recover those benefits when the workers’ compensation case is settled.

### What is Disability Insurance?

Disability Insurance is part of the [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/About_the_State_Disability_Insurance_SDI_Program/) program. It provides partial wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers who are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy. DI benefits are paid for a short period of time only.

### Not Sure What You Need?

If you are not sure that your injury or illness is work-related, a physician/practitioner may be able to determine the cause of your condition. If you think that a work-related disability occurred, you must report it to your employer. A physician/practitioner must submit a medical report to your employer’s workers’ compensation insurance company.

### Need to File an Appeal?

If you, your employer, or your employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier disagree on the workers’ compensation claim, contact the [Department of Industrial Relation, Division of Workers’ Compensation](http://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/dwc_home_page.htm) for information about the appeal process.

If you are disqualified from receiving DI or Paid Family Leave benefits, you have the [right to appeal](/en/disability/appeals/) any decision electronically or in writing within 30 days of the date your form was issued.

Nonindustrial Disability Insurance https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/nonindustrial/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Nonindustrial Disability Insurance (NDI) provides partial wage replacement to eligible State employees who have a loss of wages due to a non-work-related disability.

A disability is an illness or injury that prevents you from performing your regular work. The illness or injury can be physical or mental and can include elective surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, or other related medical conditions.

**For Family Care Leave:** [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance - Family Care Leave (NDI-FCL)](/en/disability/nonindustrial/family-care-leave/) provides partial wage replacement to eligible state employees who are enrolled in the Annual Leave Program (ALP) and are excluded from bargaining or are an employee represented by a specific bargaining unit that has NDI-FCL language in their Memorandum of Understanding.

## Who is covered?

NDI benefits are available to:

* Permanent or probationary full-time or intermittent employees in “compensated employment” (in pay status and not separated by a formal leave of absence) who are members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) or the State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS).
* Employees who are excluded from collective bargaining and are full-time, permanent part-time, or intermittent officers or employees of the State Legislature, who are not civil service members.
* California State University employees appointed half-time or more for either one year of service or one academic year or more, are also covered.

**Note:** Permanent part-time and intermittent employees must have the equivalent of six monthly pay periods of service in the past 18 months. These periods must come immediately before the pay period the disability begins. These employees are eligible on a prorated basis.

No employee contributions, enrollment fees, or medical examinations are required to be covered.

### Eligibility Requirements

NDI covers excluded employees and rank-and-file employees in bargaining units 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, and 19. [CalHR](http://calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/non-industrial-disability-insurance.aspx) is responsible for contract administration.

For state employees in bargaining units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21, you will be covered by [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/).

To be eligible for NDI benefits, you must:

* Be a State employee who is not covered by SDI.
* Be unable to do your normal and usual work for at least eight days due to a non-work-related disability.
* Have lost wages because of your disability.

## File a Claim

### Filing Your Claim

Ask your employer’s personnel specialist or payroll officer for the *First Claim for Nonindustrial Disability Insurance (NDI)* (DE 8501) because they first must confirm you are enrolled in the Annual Leave Program and excluded from bargaining. Contact us at 1-866-758-9768 to get medical extension forms.

Your employer will complete and sign **Part A - Employer Information**.

You will complete and sign **Part B - Claim Statement of Employee**.

Things to Know About Your Claim Start Date

* The day you became unable to work due to your disability is the **date your disability begins**.
* You can file your claim after the first day your disability begins.
* If you have any questions about your claim start date, **before** filing your claim contact us at 1-866-758-9768 .
* Your claim may have a 7 or 10 day waiting period.  Check with your Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or personnel specialist for additional details about your waiting period.

## Manage Your Claim

### Receiving Benefits

Your employer issues benefit payments of up to $250 per week for 26 weeks (182 days) with a waiting period of 7 or 10 days. The benefit amount and rules about using leave credits vary based on your employment status and bargaining unit.

If you participate in the California’s annual leave program, you are eligible to receive Enhanced NDI (ENDI) benefits of 50% of your gross pay. This can be supplemented with leave credits at 75% or 100%.

State and federal taxes will be withheld from NDI benefits. Voluntary deductions, such as health insurance premiums, credit union loans, savings accounts, bonds, and parking fees, will automatically be deducted from NDI benefits unless you cancel. If you continue to deduct your health insurance premium, your employer’s contribution will also continue.

### Get a Medical Certification

Medical certifications are required for disability and caregiver claims to receive NDI or NDI-FCL benefits.

Unlike SDI, NDI is not an automated program. Paper forms still need to be filled out to begin or extend the medical portion of a claim.

Talk to your licensed health professional about their process for submitting a medical certification (not all medical offices follow the same steps or process).

**Note:** Your claim is not complete until your licensed health professional completes a medical certification.

You can get medical extension forms by contacting us at 1-866-758-9768.

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

More than 18 million California workers are covered by the California State Disability Insurance (SDI) program. SDI is a partial wage-replacement insurance plan for eligible California workers. SDI is a deduction from employees’ wages. This is usually shown as “CASDI” on your paystub.

## Disability Insurance

Disability Insurance (DI) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers who have a loss of wages when they are unable to work due to a non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy.

DI does not provide job protection, only monetary benefits; however, your job may be protected through other federal or state laws such as the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) or the [California Family Rights Act (CFRA)](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/).

Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides benefits to people who need to take time off work to:

* Bond with a new child entering the family through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.
* Participate in a qualifying event resulting from an eligible family member’s military deployment to a foreign country.

## SDI for State Employees

State employees are divided into 21 bargaining units. SDI covers employees in bargaining units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21.  
SDI pays part of an employee’s wages if they have to stop working due to any of the following:

* A pregnancy or to bond with a new child entering the family through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.

Disability Insurance Claim Process https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/DI_Claim_Process/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Disability Insurance (DI) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers.

## Follow These Steps

### 1. Review Your Eligibility

You must be eligible to receive DI benefits. Some requirements are:

* You aren't able to do your regular work for at least eight consecutive days.
* You've lost wages because of your disability.
* You're employed or actively looking for work at the time your disability began.
* You're being treated by a licensed health professional.

View the complete list of [eligibility requirements](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_DI_Benefits/).

**Note:** Citizenship and immigration status do not affect eligibility.

You may also be interested in visiting:

* [Calculating DI Benefit Payment Amounts](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/)
* [Integration of Benefits](/en/disability/integration-coordination/)
* [Part Time Intermittent Reduced Work Schedule](/en/disability/part-time_intermittent_reduced_work_schedule/)
* [Voluntary Plan](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/)
* [Self-Employed – Eligibility for Disability Insurance Elective Coverage](/en/disability/Self-Employed_Eligibility/)

### 2. File Your Claim

You have two [options to file for DI benefits](/en/disability/options_to_file_for_di_benefits/). You can file your claim using [SDI Online](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_in_sdi_online/) (recommended) or by submitting the *Claim for Disability Insurance (DI) Benefits* (DE 2501) by mail.

For more information, review:

* [How to File a Disability Insurance Claim in SDI Online](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_in_sdi_online/)
* [How to File a Disability Insurance Claim by Mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/)

**Note:** The EDD will not process your claim until your application is properly completed.

#### Your Claim Start Date

To be eligible for benefits, you must be losing wages because your disability is preventing your regular work. This means you're not working or you're working reduced hours.

The first day you can't do your regular work because of your disability is **the date your disability begins**. You **may not** change the start date of your claim or adjust your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) after establishing a valid claim. A valid claim means there are still wages in your base period. 

**Important:** The base claim period for a pregnancy disability claim and the resulting weekly benefit amount is the same one that will be used for the following Paid Family Leave bonding claim for new mothers.

If you have any questions about your claim start date, contact DI at 1-800-480-3287 **before** filing your claim.

#### When to File Your Claim

You can file your claim on the first day of your disability, but to avoid creating delays on your claim, losing benefits, or having your claim disqualified, you should file your claim:

* No earlier than nine days after your disability begins.
* No later than 49 days after your disability begins.

**Note:** If you have a good reason for filing late, include a letter to explain your reasons when you file your claim so the claims analyst can review your information to make a determination.

Choose your [payment option](/en/about_edd/your-benefit-payment-options/) when you file your claim:

* Direct deposit (SDI Online claims only)
* Debit card
* Check

### 3. Get a Medical Certification

Your licensed health professional must certify to your disability by completing and submitting the medical certification using either SDI Online or the DE 2501 *Part B – Physician/Practitioner’s Certificate* of the paper claim form. It is **your responsibility** to have your licensed health professional complete and sign the certification and submit it to us within 49 days from the date your disability begins so you don't lose benefits or have your claim disqualified.

* A nurse practitioner may certify to a disability within their scope of practice; however, they must perform a physical examination and collaborate with a physician or surgeon.
* A licensed midwife, nurse-midwife, or nurse practitioner may complete the medical certification for disabilities related to normal pregnancy or childbirth.
* If you are under the care of an accredited religious practitioner, you can download and print the [*Claim for Disability Insurance Benefits-Religious Practitioner’s Certificate* (DE 2502) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de2502.pdf) for them to complete.

**Note:** Your claim is not complete until your licensed health professional completes a medical certification.

### 4. Eligibility Status Determined

Once we receive your completed claim application, we will determine your eligibility. You can expect this process to take up to 14 days.

**Note:** Processing time may vary depending upon the claim. If your claim is incomplete or requires additional information, confirming eligibility can be delayed.

During this time, we will send you a *Notice of Computation* (DE 429D) to inform you of your potential weekly benefit amount based on the wages you earned in your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/).  
  
**Note:** Receiving this notice does not confirm your eligibility to receive DI benefits.

**Eligible for Benefits**  
If you are eligible for benefits, we will send you an *Electronic Benefit Payment Notification* (DE 2500E) with information about your first benefit payment.

Before you receive benefits, you must serve an unpaid seven-day waiting period (calendar days). The first payable day is the eighth day of the claim.

Review the [DI Benefits and Payments FAQs](/en/disability/faqs-benefits-payments/) for more information.

### If We Can't Determine Your Eligibility

We'll contact you by phone or mail for more information. We may also need to contact your employer or licensed health professional.

**Not Eligible for Benefits**  
If you are not eligible, we will send you a *Notice of Determination* (DE 2517) and an *Appeal Form* (DE 1000A). You have the right to [appeal](/en/disability/appeals/) any decision by completing the DE 1000A electronically or by mail within 30 days of the date your form was issued.

### 5. Continue or Stop Your Benefits

### Continue Benefits

**If You’re Receiving Automatic Payments**  
If you are on automatic payment, we will send you a *Disability Claim Continuing Eligibility Certification* (DE 2593) after 10 weeks of payment. You must return this form to us to certify that your disability continues. If you do not return the DE 2593, your benefits will stop.

**If You’re Not Receiving Automatic Payments**  
If you are not on automatic payment, we will send you a *Claim for Continued Disability Benefits* (DE 2500A) every two weeks to certify that your disability continues. If you do not return the DE 2500A, your benefits will stop.

The quickest way to submit the DE 2593 or DE 2500A is through [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).

**Extend Your Benefit Period If You Have Not Recovered**  
You may be eligible to receive benefits through the return-to-work or recovery date your physician/practitioner provides us. With your final payment, we will mail you a *Physician/Practitioner’s Supplementary Certificate* (DE 2525XX).

If you have not fully recovered and want to continue benefits, you must have your physician/practitioner complete the DE 2525XX and return the form to us to certify your continuing disability. Your physician/practitioner may complete and submit the DE 2525XX using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) or by [mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/).

### Discontinue Benefits

**Stop Benefits If You Have Recovered or Returned to Work**  
If you recover or return to work on the date your physician/practitioner provided to us, no further action is required to stop your claim.

If you have been approved to go back to work **before** the physician/practitioner’s estimated date of recovery, complete one of the following:

* The Disability Status section of the *Claim for Continued Disability Benefits* (DE 2500A).
* The Recovery or Return to Work Certification portion of the *Notice of Automatic Payment* (DE 2587).
* Question 1 of the *Disability Claim Continuing Eligibility Questionnaire* (DE 2593).
* Use the **Claim Update** function on [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/).

If you previously recovered or returned to work and became ill or injured again, immediately file a new claim form (DE 2501) and report the dates you worked.

Roles of Licensed Health Professionals in State Disability Insurance https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/Physicians-Practitioners/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

## Certify and Manage Patient Claims

If your patient or their caregiver are eligible for State Disability Insurance (SDI), they may be covered by one of two benefits: Disability Insurance (DI) or Paid Family Leave (PFL).

The quality, accuracy, and timeliness of your medical certifications are important to the processing of their DI or PFL claim.

### Who Can Certify

We review claims to ensure that all eligibility requirements are met; this includes verification of your health professional’s license which must be active and in good standing.

The following licensed health professionals can certify claims:

* Licensed medical or osteopathic physician/practitioners
* Authorized medical officer of a U.S. Government facility
* Chiropractor
* Podiatrist
* Optometrist
* Dentist
* Psychologist
* Nurse practitioner or physician assistant
* Licensed midwife, nurse-midwife, or nurse practitioner for pregnancy, childbirth, or postpartum conditions consistent with the scope of their professional licensing.
* Accredited religious practitioner

**Important:** Effective January 1, 2024, [Senate Bill 667](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB667) changes the scope of nurse midwife certification authorization.

### How to Certify Claims

If your patient or their caregiver asks you for a medical certification for their SDI claim, you can fill out and submit the form using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/). For more information, visit the [Certify and Manage Claims - Basics for Licensed Health Professionals](/en/disability/Basics_for_Physicians-Practitioners/) page.

## Independent Medical Examiner Information

The State Disability Insurance (SDI) program has a panel of Independent Medical Examiners. These are licensed health professionals responsible for the supplemental examinations that verify a disability status by providing a second medical opinion when the original certification is in question. Examinations by the SDI program follow the guidelines listed in [Section 2627(c)-1(b) of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=I06F3D3C0D4B711DE8879F88E8B0DAAAE&transitionType=Default&contextData=%28sc.Default%29#IC10399C8AA3641A2B98947DD7AC9FD55).

For example, SDI may request an examination if a licensed health professional lists the claimant’s disability as lasting longer than what is considered normal for the diagnosis but doesn’t provide a medically justified reason.

Independent medical examinations assist SDI in preserving the Disability Fund for the benefit of workers who are insured through SDI.

Nonindustrial Disability Insurance-Family Care Leave https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/nonindustrial/family-care-leave/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

## Program Overview

Nonindustrial Disability Insurance-Family Care Leave (NDI-FCL) provides partial wage replacement for up to six weeks within any 12-month period to:

* Care for a seriously ill family member (child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner).
* Bond with a new child entering the family through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.
* Participate in a qualifying event because of a family member’s (spouse, registered domestic partner, parent, or child) military deployment to a foreign country.

## Who is covered?

NDI-FCL covers excluded, exempt, supervisory, managerial, or confidential employees and specific bargaining units. [CalHR](http://calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/non-industrial-disability-insurance.aspx) is responsible for contract administration.

Some state employees are not covered by NDI-FCL but are covered by State Disability Insurance (SDI) which includes Paid Family Leave (PFL) through a negotiated agreement. State employees in bargaining units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21, are covered by SDI PFL. For information about SDI, visit [About the State Disability Insurance Program](/en/disability/About_the_State_Disability_Insurance_SDI_Program/). For specific information about PFL visit [Paid Family Leave](/en/disability/paid-family-leave/).

NDI-FCL benefits are available to:

* Permanent or probationary full-time or intermittent employees who are members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) or the State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and in “compensated employment” (meaning you are in pay status and not separated by a formal leave of absence).
* Employees who are excluded from collective bargaining and are full-time, permanent part-time, or intermittent officers or employees of the State Legislature, who are not civil service members.
* California State University employees appointed half-time or more for either one year of service or one academic year or more, are also covered.
* Employees not represented by a bargaining unit or represented by a specific bargaining unit that has Family Care Leave language in their Memorandum of Understanding (Contact your personnel specialist for more details.)

## Eligibility

To be eligible for NDI-FCL, you must:

* Be a state employee who is eligible for NDI-FCL and not covered by SDI PFL. Non leave earning exempt employees are not eligible.
* Be enrolled in the Annual Leave Program (ALP)
* Be a full-time employee; or,
* Be a part-time employee with six months of service within the last 18 months; or,
* Be an intermittent employee with a total of 960 hours of employment.
* Be unable to do your normal or usual work because you must take family leave for care, bonding, or a military assist event.
* Have a wage loss due to your need for family leave.

## Claim Process

## NDI-FCL Wages and Payment Process

We will determine your eligibility for NDI-FCL and approve benefit payments. We will send you a *Notice of Eligibility for Nonindustrial Disability Insurance or Nonindustrial Disability Insurance - Family Care Leave* *(NDI-FCL)* (DE 8500). We will also send an *Authorization to Pay Nonindustrial Disability Insurance or Nonindustrial Disability Insurance - Family Care Leave**(NDI-FCL)* (DE 8500A) to your employer. These notices provide the time period you are approved for a NDI-FCL claim.

Once your employer’s personnel office receives the DE 8500A, they must authorize and request the [State Controller](https://www.sco.ca.gov/) or paying agent to issue benefit payments to you.

Benefits are paid based on your employer’s payment schedule. Once we authorize your benefits, questions concerning your NDI-FCL benefits, including payment status, weekly rates, payment amounts, and deductions should be directed to your attendance clerk or personnel office.

You are not required to serve a waiting period before benefits are paid.

* NDI-FCL provides wages for up to 6 weeks (42 days) per claim in a 12-month period.
* You will receive 50% of your gross monthly salary.
* You can use leave credits to supplement your salary at 75% or 100%.

### Retirement or Service Credit

* State employer contributions to your retirement account will not be made while you are receiving NDI-FCL.
* You will not earn service credit from the [California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS)](https://www.calpers.ca.gov/) or California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) for the 50% NDI-FCL wages. All service credit is earned for time worked or supplemented with the leave you earn.

### Benefit Payment Exceptions

Benefits are not payable for any day that you:

* Are eligible for temporary [workers’ compensation benefits](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) or [Industrial Disability Leave](https://www.dgs.ca.gov/OHR/Resources/Page-Content/Office-of-Human-Resources-Resources-List-Folder/Personnel-Operations-Manual/Industrial-Disability-Leave).
* Receive full wages in the form of sick leave, vacation, compensatory time off, or catastrophic leave.
* Are paid unemployment benefits.
* Are separated or retired from state service.

Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides benefit payments to people who need to take time off work to:

* Care for a seriously ill family member.
* Bond with a new child.

Voluntary Plan https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

California employers or a majority of employees can apply to the EDD for approval to provide a plan for short-term disability insurance and family leave, known as a Voluntary Plan (VP), instead of [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/) coverage. Both SDI and VP provide short-term wage replacement disability insurance and family leave benefits.

* [## Getting Started](#pane-3ca178e5-10e0-4380-8233-9fab6f50f9a9)
* [## Manage Claims](#pane-2150c4e5-033a-45fa-a0c0-3141f36780f8)
* [## Tax Reporting](#pane-a41661ec-f32f-4439-8a83-09d3704cfeef)

## Getting Started

In order to offer VP, you must first apply and get approval from the EDD. For information on how to apply, visit [Become a Voluntary Plan Employer](/en/disability/Pre-Requisites_for_Becoming_a_Voluntary_Plan_Employer/).

A VP must:

* Offer the same benefits to employees as SDI.
* Provides at least one benefit that is better than SDI.
* Not cost employees more than SDI.
* Be updated to match any increase in benefits that SDI implements from legislation or approved regulation.

## Manage Claims

You can process VP claims conveniently and securely using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) to submit State Award Request (SAR). To set up your online account, visit [Manage Your Voluntary Plan](/en/disability/VP_Online_Services/).

## Tax Reporting

You do not need to send in [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/) contributions for employees covered under a Voluntary Plan (VP). But, you must send SDI contributions for employees with SDI coverage. Any contributions that are required from VP employees must be secured in a trust fund. For any employees who opt-out, you (employer) must send their SDI contributions to the EDD Tax Branch. To learn how to file online, visit [Voluntary Plan Tax Reporting](/en/disability/Tax_Reporting_on_VP_Accounts/).

## Contact the Voluntary Plan Group

For assistance, you can contact the Voluntary Plan Group by phone, email, or mail:

* Email: [VPProgram@edd.ca.gov](mailto:VPProgram@edd.ca.gov)

[Español](/es/about_edd/conditions-of-use-policy/)

# Conditions of Use Policy

Thank you for visiting the State of California’s website and reviewing our Use Policy. You should also be aware that the State has a [Privacy Policy](/en/about_edd/privacy_policy/), also available on this website. The State wants you to know about the collection, use, security, and access to information that may be obtained through use of the State’s web portal. By visiting this website, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Notice. This Notice covers the topics listed below.

Please note that this Use Policy is subject to change without notice, and that it reflects the State’s current business practices. This Use policy is dated December 7, 2000.

Also note that each department within the State may have additional privacy and use policies specific to the mission and needs of their work. Be sure to review those policies as you access additional sites within the State.

Show All

## [Personal Information and Choice](#collapse-96a999ac-fa09-4092-adb8-f3a2df449907)

"Personal information" is information about a natural person that identifies or describes an individual, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, and medical or employment history, readily identifiable to that specific individual. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information; however, it is considered "electronically collected personal information."

According to Government Code § 11015.5., "electronically collected personal information" means any information that is maintained by an agency that identifies or describes an individual user, including, but not limited to, his or her name, social security number, physical description, home address, home telephone number, education, financial matters, medical or employment history, password, electronic mail address, and information that reveals any network location or identity, but excludes any information manually submitted to a State agency by a user, whether electronically or in written form, and information on or relating to individuals who are users, serving in a business capacity, including, but not limited to, business owners, officers, or principals of that business.

"Electronically collected personal information" that we automatically collect includes your domain name or Internet Protocol address, and statistical information about which web pages you visit. If you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for specific information (i.e., completing a request for assistance, personalizing the content of the website, sending an email, or participating in a survey) more detailed data will be collected. If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the website.

If any type of personal information is requested on the website or volunteered by the user, State law, including the Information Practices Act of 1977, Government Code Section 11015.5., and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information may be a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise protected by federal or State law.

Additionally, departments and agencies of the State of California under the authority of the Governor are required to adhere to the Privacy Policy which is also accessible on this website.

## [A Special Note about Children](#collapse-ebe09900-d1d9-4ebd-ac67-cce5d81eabf1)

Children are not eligible to use services that require submission of personal information, and we require that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us. This includes submitting personal information to the State as part of a user profile or personalization profile. If you are a minor, you can use these services only if used together with your parents or guardians. If you are a minor, you should seek guidance from your parents.

If the State decides to begin collecting personal information from children, it will notify parents that it is being requested, disclose the reasons for collecting it, and disclose our intended use of it. The State will seek parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information. If it does collect it, parents may request information on the type of data being collected, view their child’s information, and, if they choose, prohibit the State from making further use of their child’s information. The State will not provide personal information about children to third parties.

## [Information Collected and How It Is Used](#collapse-2604f6bf-f717-4c4b-8737-0d620d781710)

We do collect personal information directly from individuals who volunteer to use some of our services. Collection of this information is required to deliver the specific services, but use of these services is voluntary.

If you do nothing during your visit to the website but browse or download information, we automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:

1. The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used, but not the email address. The Internet Protocol Address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you and generate statistics used in the management of this site;
2. The type of browser and operating system you used;
3. The date and time you visited this site;
4. The web pages or services you accessed at this site;
5. The website you visited prior to coming to this website;
6. The website you visit as you leave this website; and
7. If you downloaded a form, the form that was downloaded.

The information we automatically collect or store is used to improve the content of our web services and to help us understand how people are using our services. This information does not identify you personally and is used for gathering website statistics. The information we automatically collect and store in our logs about your visit helps us to analyze our website to continually improve the value of the materials available. Our website logs do not identify a visitor by personal information, and we make no attempt to link other websites with the individuals that browse the State’s website.

Government Code § 11015.5.(a)(6) prohibits all state agencies from distributing or selling any electronically collected personal information, as defined above, about users to any third party without the permission of the user. The State does not sell any "electronically collected personal information." Any distribution of "electronically collected personal information" will be solely for the purposes for which it was provided to us.

The State may provide or distribute certain lists and statistical reports of regulatory information as provided by law, but no personal information is sold or distributed, and all relevant legal protections still apply to the State’s websites.

## [What Happens To Information You Submit To Us?](#collapse-f9d8683b-3762-4764-a7b5-4e9bfbbf8b3d)

If you choose to submit information to us, the information will be transmitted through secure lines to our departmental database. Any private information will only be used for the purposes for which it was provided and will not be shared with another entity except as prescribed by law. Please see our Privacy Policy for additional information.

## [Use of Internet Request for Assistance Form Information](#collapse-02e13d9b-f916-49f6-aba6-e3dc9276dff7)

Any information you provide to us will only be shared with entities involved in your case as necessary. Information you provide may be included with other consumers’ information to be used for statistical reporting, trending data, and/or investigative actions. For example, we may need to retain information that becomes part of an enforcement action or consumer complaint case for a period of time after the closing date of the case.

If you provide us with information regarding an issue that does not fall within our regulatory jurisdiction, we may refer your information to the appropriate local, State, or federal agency on your behalf.

## [Surveys](#collapse-b54ceb11-90fe-4339-b755-d92fa840a3f0)

If during your visit to the State’s website you participate in a survey or send an email, the following additional information will be collected:

1. The email address and contents of the email; and
2. Information volunteered in response to the survey.

The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.

The information is retained in accordance with Government Code § 11015.5.

## [If You Send Us Email](#collapse-62e911f0-e4d0-4e20-b9a9-22aa117dbde3)

You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in email with a comment or question. We use the information to improve our service to you or to respond to your request. Sometimes we forward your email to other State employees who may be better able to help you, and this staff may be employed by a different agency within the State. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations or, as required by law, we do not share our email with any other organizations.

We use your email to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to further improve our website, or to forward the email to another agency for appropriate action.

## [Order Forms](#collapse-f58456b8-263f-4ada-bae0-d7ab993a51ff)

If you place an order with us, we request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your order/request. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you.

## [Public Disclosure](#collapse-247ff7a5-21f2-4a02-a4bb-11cb0300a4f5)

In the State of California, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by State government. At the same time, there are exceptions to the public’s right to access public records. These exceptions serve various needs including maintaining the privacy of individuals. Both State and federal laws provide exceptions.

All information collected at this site becomes public record that may be subject to inspection and copying by the public, unless an exemption in law exists. In the event of a conflict between this Use Policy and the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, or other law governing the disclosure of records, the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, or other applicable law will control.

Family and Medical Leave Act and California Family Rights Act FAQs https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/faqs-fmla-cfra/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Find answers to the frequently asked questions about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) employee leave laws.

For detailed information about FMLA, visit the [Department of Labor](http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/index.htm) or call 1-866-487-2365.

For detailed information about CFRA, visit the [Civil Rights Department](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/) or call 1-800-884-1684.

## What are the FMLA and CFRA laws?

The FMLA and the CFRA are federal and state leave laws that allow eligible employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave.

FMLA and CFRA help to protect your job while you are receiving Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits when you must:

* Take medical leave for yourself.
* Care for a family member who is seriously ill.
* Bond with a new child.
* Participate in a qualifying event because of a family member’s military deployment to a foreign country.

## What is the difference between Disability Insurance, Paid Family Leave, and employee leave laws?

Disability Insurance (DI) and Paid Family Leave (PFL) provide wage replacement benefits only; they do not provide job protection. DI and PFL do not change the federal or state leave laws in any way and are completely separate from them. Your job may be protected under other employee leave laws, such as the [FMLA](http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/index.htm) or the [CFRA](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/).

DI provides up to 52 weeks of paid benefits when you are unable to work and have a wage loss due to your own non-work-related illness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth.

PFL provides up to eight weeks of paid benefits when you have a wage loss due to taking time off work to:

* Care for a seriously ill family member.
* Bond with a new child.
* Participate in a qualifying event because of a family member’s military deployment to a foreign country.

## Do Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave protect my job when I am receiving benefits?

No. Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave provide wage replacement benefits only; they do not provide job protection. Your job may be protected under other employee leave laws, such as the [FMLA](http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/index.htm) or [CFRA](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/).

## Can my employer require me to take leave under the FMLA and CFRA when I am receiving Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits?

Yes. If your company is covered by the terms of [FMLA](http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/index.htm) and [CFRA](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/), your employer may require you to take FMLA and CFRA leave while you’re receiving Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits.

## Direct Deposit

Show All

### [What are the advantages of directly depositing my payments?](#collapse-8ca9e7ac-2d2a-4ee4-af63-9f4680e15d8f)

Direct deposit is a safe, fast, and easy option to receive your benefit payments. You can have your benefits electronically deposited into your personal checking or savings account.

### [How do I start the direct deposit process?](#collapse-7823e69c-6227-430d-8548-9f53d12fb5fa)

If you are an existing customer or applying for unemployment, disability, or Paid Family Leave benefits, just follow the instructions on our [direct deposit webpage](/en/about_edd/your-benefit-payment-options/benefit-payment-option-direct-deposit/) to start the direct deposit process. All you need is your bank information, including your bank routing number. If you do not have a checking or savings account, visit the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](https://www.fdic.gov/getbanked/pdf/top-reasons-to-open-a-bank-account.pdf) to learn more about the many benefits of banking services.

 

### [When can I expect my payment to be deposited?](#collapse-fe6a0a1f-03b3-4e93-9646-a2d2d47b2ff3)

If you are eligible for benefits, your payments are usually deposited into your bank account within three days.

The timing of when you receive your direct deposit varies based on when your bank processes the payment.

Payments deposited to your bank account show as “UI Deposit” or “DI Deposit”.

**Note:** Holidays and weekends will delay your payment until the next business day.

Integration of Wages with Benefits FAQs https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/faq_integration_coordination/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Integration of wages with Disability Insurance (DI) or Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits, also known as coordination or supplementation, is when an employee receives their full DI or PFL [weekly benefit amount](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) and is also paid wages from their employer or uses available leave to cover the difference between their benefit amount and their regular wages. Visit [Integration of Benefits](/en/disability/integration-coordination/) for more information.

## How much will an employee get with integration benefits?

This process may allow you to receive up to 100 percent of your normal weekly salary during a period of disability or family leave while using a reduced amount of your leave balance or receiving wages from your employer.

**Example:** Your current gross (before taxes and deductions) weekly wage is $500. The weekly benefit amount from PFL is $275. The $500 minus $275 equals a $225 per week wage loss. Your employer can integrate a maximum amount of $225 per week in gross wages to you, allowing you to receive up to 100 percent of your normal weekly gross pay.

When the integration process is used by your employer, and we confirm this process, we will pay your full DI or PFL benefits.  

**Note:** It is the responsibility of both you and your employer to make sure that you are not receiving more than 100 percent of your normal weekly salary when receiving integrated wages along with the DI or PFL weekly benefit amount. 

## Can the EDD tell an employer how much an employee is getting in DI or PFL benefits?

We may give this information to an employer if their employee provides written permission on their initial DI or PFL claim forms. The employee must answer **Yes** to the question, “May we disclose benefit payment information to your employer(s)?” when completing their claim form. If the employer integrates with DI or PFL, they need this information to make sure the right amount of wages are paid to the employee. 

An employee can also submit a separate written letter giving us permission to disclose benefit payment information to their employer.

## What does the law require for wage integration with DI and PFL?

DI and PFL are partial wage-replacement programs, meaning that if an employee takes time off work due to a disability or the need to care for a seriously ill family member, bond with a new child, or participate in a qualifying military event, they must have a wage loss to qualify for benefits.

Wages received during this time, plus DI or PFL benefits, cannot be more than the employee’s normal weekly salary (excluding overtime pay) before the start of the disability or family leave period.

To review the law, visit [California Unemployment Insurance Code Section 2656](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=UIC&division=1.&title=&part=2.&chapter=2.&article=2.).

## What types of payments or benefits are considered wages that need to be reported?

The most common types of payments are sick leave, bereavement pay, back pay, and earnings (full or partial return to work). For more information, visit [Reporting Your Wages or Work Status for DI](/en/disability/Reporting_Your_Wages_DI/) and [Reporting Your Wages - PFL](/en/disability/Reporting_Your_Wages_PFL/).

**Note:** Employees can use leave credits such as sick leave, vacation, and other paid time off to add to their claim benefits. Leave credits can be used during the seven-day waiting period for DI claims.

## Can an employee receive vacation benefits from their employer and still receive DI or PFL benefits?

DI - Yes. Vacation benefits are not in conflict with DI.

PFL - Yes. Vacation can be used to supplement your PFL benefits so you can receive up to 100 percent pay.

Your employer may require you to use up to two weeks of vacation before receiving PFL benefits. If your employer requires that you use vacation first, you won’t receive PFL benefits for those days. You will receive PFL benefits after you have used the vacation leave required by your employer.

## Can an employee receive sick leave or other paid leave from their employer and still receive DI or PFL benefits?

Yes, but depending on the type of paid leave and how much you receive, your DI or PFL benefits may be reduced or denied.

**Vacation Pay:** You can receive DI benefits at the same time.

**Sick Pay:** You cannot receive DI benefits if you also receive sick leave wages that equal your full salary. If you receive only partial sick leave wages, you may be eligible for full or partial DI benefits.

**Other Pay:** All other pay, including holiday pay, must be reported to confirm your eligibility.

The first seven days of your DI claim is a non-payable waiting period. Any type of wages paid by the employer during the waiting period do not conflict with DI benefits.

**Example:** Your current gross (before taxes and deductions) weekly wage is $500. The weekly benefit amount from PFL is $275. The $500 minus $275 equals a $225 per week wage loss. Your employer can integrate a maximum amount of $225 per week in gross wages to you, allowing you to receive up to 100 percent of your normal weekly gross pay.

When the integration process is used by your employer, and we confirm this process, we will pay your full DI or PFL benefits.  

**Note:** It is the responsibility of both you and your employer to make sure that you are not receiving more than 100 percent of your normal weekly salary when receiving integrated wages along with the DI or PFL weekly benefit amount.

---- ## Can the EDD tell an employer how much an employee is getting in DI or PFL benefits?:

We may give this information to an employer if their employee provides written permission on their initial DI or PFL claim forms. The employee must answer **Yes** to the question, “May we disclose benefit payment information to your employer(s)?” when completing their claim form. If the employer integrates with DI or PFL, they need this information to make sure the right amount of wages are paid to the employee. 

An employee can also submit a separate written letter giving us permission to disclose benefit payment information to their employer.

---- ## What does the law require for wage integration with DI and PFL?:

DI and PFL are partial wage-replacement programs, meaning that if an employee takes time off work due to a disability or the need to care for a seriously ill family member, bond with a new child, or participate in a qualifying military event, they must have a wage loss to qualify for benefits.

Wages received during this time, plus DI or PFL benefits, cannot be more than the employee’s normal weekly salary (excluding overtime pay) before the start of the disability or family leave period.

To review the law, visit [California Unemployment Insurance Code Section 2656](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=UIC&division=1.&title=&part=2.&chapter=2.&article=2.).

---- ## What types of payments or benefits are considered wages that need to be reported?:

The most common types of payments are sick leave, bereavement pay, back pay, and earnings (full or partial return to work). For more information, visit [Reporting Your Wages or Work Status for DI](/en/disability/Reporting_Your_Wages_DI/) and [Reporting Your Wages - PFL](/en/disability/Reporting_Your_Wages_PFL/).

**Note:** Employees can use leave credits such as sick leave, vacation, and other paid time off to add to their claim benefits. Leave credits can be used during the seven-day waiting period for DI claims.

---- ## Can an employee receive vacation benefits from their employer and still receive DI or PFL benefits?:

DI - Yes. Vacation benefits are not in conflict with DI.

PFL - Yes. Vacation can be used to supplement your PFL benefits so you can receive up to 100 percent pay.

Your employer may require you to use up to two weeks of vacation before receiving PFL benefits. If your employer requires that you use vacation first, you won’t receive PFL benefits for those days. You will receive PFL benefits after you have used the vacation leave required by your employer.

---- ## Can an employee receive sick leave or other paid leave from their employer and still receive DI or PFL benefits?:

Yes, but depending on the type of paid leave and how much you receive, your DI or PFL benefits may be reduced or denied.

**Vacation Pay:** You can receive DI benefits at the same time.

**Sick Pay:** You cannot receive DI benefits if you also receive sick leave wages that equal your full salary. If you receive only partial sick leave wages, you may be eligible for full or partial DI benefits.

**Other Pay:** All other pay, including holiday pay, must be reported to confirm your eligibility.

The first seven days of your DI claim is a non-payable waiting period. Any type of wages paid by the employer during the waiting period do not conflict with DI benefits.

Disability Insurance – Pregnancy FAQs https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/faq_di_pregnancy/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Have questions regarding [Disability Insurance (DI)](/en/disability/disability_insurance/) and [Paid Family Leave (PFL)](/en/disability/paid-family-leave/)?

Find answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) on how the California [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/) program provides short-term disability and PFL benefits. Both DI and PFL are wage replacement benefits available to eligible workers who need time off work.

## If I’m pregnant, when do I file for Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave?

**Disability Insurance (DI)**  
When your licensed health professional certifies that you are unable to work due to your pregnancy, you can file a DI claim for your pregnancy-related disability and recovery from delivery.

If your pregnancy-related condition will require you to stop working earlier than four weeks prior to your baby’s estimated due date, you can file a claim sooner. Your licensed health professional can certify to longer periods during pregnancy and/or after birth if you have a pregnancy-related condition that prevents you from performing your normal or usual job duties.

Learn more on how to [apply for disability](/en/disability/apply/) and set up and [manage](/en/disability/manage/) your benefits through your [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) account.

**Paid Family Leave (PFL)**  
Once you have recovered from your pregnancy-related disability and your licensed health professional has said you can return to work, you can file a [PFL](/en/disability/paid-family-leave/) claim. PFL pays up to eight weeks of benefits to bond with your new child.

When your last DI benefit check is issued, we will automatically send you a *Claim for Paid Family Leave (PFL) Benefits - New Mother* (DE 2501FP) or the link will be sent to your SDI Online inbox.

## I just found out I’m pregnant. Can I send in my claim form before I stop working?

No. Your claim begins when you lose wages and your licensed health professional confirms that you are unable to do your normal or usual job duties. However, if your licensed health professional certifies that you must limit your hours of work or change your work duties because of your pregnancy, you may be eligible for benefits.

## I’m a farmworker who became disabled during the off-season. Am I eligible for Disability Insurance benefits?

[Legal precedent](https://cuiab.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/precedent-decisions/pd513.pdf) has determined that certain seasonal workers may be eligible for Disability Insurance benefits if their disability starts in the off-season and they have not left the labor market. If you think you are eligible for disability benefits, [file a claim](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/) and EDD will determine your eligibility for benefits.  

## As a farmworker, pesticide exposure presents a risk to my baby or my health during pregnancy. Can I file for Disability Insurance benefits?

Yes. Health care providers may certify a patient as disabled for State Disability Insurance benefits if the patient’s job requirements pose a danger to the health of a pregnant patient or the fetus. If your licensed health professional finds that it is not medically safe for you to perform your normal or usual work due to exposure to pesticides, you can [apply for disability](/en/disability/apply/)

## My job requirements (lifting, continuous standing, regular chemical exposure, etc.) present a risk to my baby or my health during pregnancy. Can I file for Disability Insurance benefits?

Yes. If your licensed health professional finds that it is not medically safe for you to perform your normal or usual work, you can [apply for disability](/en/disability/apply/).

## My baby is due in two months. My job requires continuous standing, but I can’t keep standing. If I stop work early, am I still eligible for disability benefits?

You may be eligible for benefits based on your:

* Age.
* Occupation.
* Job limitations.
* Prior pregnancy history.
* Current medical condition.
* Licensed health professional's certification that you are unable to do your normal or usual work.

If you think you are eligible, [file a claim](/en/disability/disability_insurance/).

## If I file a claim for Disability Insurance due to my pregnancy, how long will I receive benefits?

Usually, disability benefits are between 10 to 12 weeks based on the following conditions of your pregnancy and delivery:

* **Without medical complications:** You can receive benefits up to four weeks before your expected delivery date and up to six weeks after your delivery.
* **By cesarean section:** You can receive benefits up to four weeks before your expected delivery date, and up to eight weeks after your delivery.

In some cases, your licensed health professional may certify to longer periods if there are medical complications or if you are unable to perform your normal or usual job duties.

## I’m going to work up to the day my baby is born. Can I add an extra week to my recovery time?

No. Once your baby is born, your benefits are limited to the period that you are unable to do your normal or usual work.

## I am a business owner/self-employed person. How do I protect myself against loss of income, if I’m unable to work due to my pregnancy?

Our [Disability Insurance Elective Coverage (DIEC)](/en/disability/Self-Employed/) program offers business owners and self-employed people the option to protect themselves against loss of income due to injury, pregnancy, or illness, whether or not it is work related.

## I’m receiving Unemployment Insurance benefits, but now I’m pregnant. Do I file for Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave?

**Disability Insurance (DI)**  
If your licensed health professional certifies that you are unable to work due to your pregnancy, you can file a DI claim for your pregnancy-related disability and recovery from delivery.

You must first stop certifying for UI benefits and [notify Unemployment Insurance (UI)](/en/unemployment/contact_ui/) that you are no longer able and available for work. UI will schedule a phone interview with you to suspend your claim because you cannot receive DI and UI benefits at the same time.

You [can apply for disability](/en/disability/apply/) by completing a one-time registration with [myEDD](/en/bpo/), then file your DI claim using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/). You can also order a *Claim for Disability Insurance (DI) Benefits* (DE 2501) from [Online Forms and Publications](https://forms.edd.ca.gov/forms) and file by mail using the paper form.

**Paid Family Leave (PFL)**  
Once you have recovered from your pregnancy-related disability and your licensed health professional has said you can return to work, you can file a PFL claim. PFL pays up to eight weeks of benefits to bond with your new baby.

When your last DI benefit check is issued, we will automatically send you a *Claim for Paid Family Leave (PFL) Benefits - New Mother* (DE 2501FP) or the link will be sent to your [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) inbox.

Workers’ Compensation FAQs https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/faq_di_workers_compensation/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Get answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) to learn when you are eligible for Disability Insurance or when to file for [Workers’ Compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) with the [Department of Industrial Relations](http://www.dir.ca.gov/), [Division of Workers’ Compensation](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/dwc_home_page.htm).

## I was hurt or got seriously ill at work. Can I still file for Disability Insurance?

Yes. You can apply for [Disability Insurance (DI](/en/disability/disability_insurance/)). However, usually you cannot be paid both [workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) and DI benefits for the same period of time except in limited situations. If you aren’t sure if you’re eligible, file a claim anyway.

## I'm not sure if my disability is work related. Who can I talk to?

A physician/practitioner can help determine if your disability is work related. If you think you have a work-related disability, you must report it to your employer. A physician/practitioner must also submit a medical report to your employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier.

Contact the [Department of Industrial Relations](http://www.dir.ca.gov/), [Division of Workers’ Compensation](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/dwc_home_page.htm) to learn more.

## I was told to file an appeal with the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board. What is the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board and what does it do?

The [Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB)](https://www.dir.ca.gov/wcab/wcab.htm) is a state agency that has the authority to resolve workers’ compensation claim issues between injured workers and their employer. If you, your employer, or your employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier disagree over issues related to your injury claim, contact the WCAB for assistance. A WCAB judge will hear your side and your employer’s side of the issue and make a decision regarding your case. The [Information and Assistance Unit](http://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/ianda.html) at the WCAB can provide more information about the appeal process and your right to file an appeal.

## I have a Supplemental Job Displacement Benefit retraining voucher. Can I still receive Disability Insurance benefits?

If you have, or expect to receive, a [Supplemental Job Displacement Benefit (SJDB) retraining voucher](/en/jobs_and_training/Eligible_Training_Provider_List/) as part of your workers’ compensation benefit, you can still [apply for Disability Insurance (DI) benefits](/en/disability/apply/). Using your SJDB retraining voucher while you apply for DI benefits will not prevent you from qualifying.

## I am receiving workers’ compensation benefits from my employer. Can I still receive Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits?

In most cases, you cannot receive Disability Insurance (DI) or Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits for the same period you are receiving Temporary Disability or Permanent Disability benefits from your employer or employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier.

However, if your workers’ compensation weekly benefit is less than your DI or PFL weekly benefit, you could receive the difference between the two rates. [Contact SDI](/en/disability/Contact_SDI/) for further information.

If you, your employer, or your employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier disagree over issues related to your injury claim, contact the WCAB for assistance. A WCAB judge will hear your side and your employer’s side of the issue and make a decision regarding your case. The [Information and Assistance Unit](http://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/ianda.html) at the WCAB can provide more information about the appeal process and your right to file an appeal.

---- ## I have a Supplemental Job Displacement Benefit retraining voucher. Can I still receive Disability Insurance benefits?:

If you have, or expect to receive, a [Supplemental Job Displacement Benefit (SJDB) retraining voucher](/en/jobs_and_training/Eligible_Training_Provider_List/) as part of your workers’ compensation benefit, you can still [apply for Disability Insurance (DI) benefits](/en/disability/apply/). Using your SJDB retraining voucher while you apply for DI benefits will not prevent you from qualifying.

---- ## I am receiving workers’ compensation benefits from my employer. Can I still receive Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits?:

In most cases, you cannot receive Disability Insurance (DI) or Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits for the same period you are receiving Temporary Disability or Permanent Disability benefits from your employer or employer’s workers’ compensation insurance carrier.

However, if your workers’ compensation weekly benefit is less than your DI or PFL weekly benefit, you could receive the difference between the two rates. [Contact SDI](/en/disability/Contact_SDI/) for further information.

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Disability Insurance (DI) provides short-term wage replacement benefits to eligible California workers.

You may be eligible for DI if you are unable to work and are losing wages because of your own non-work-related illness, injury, or pregnancy.

Get answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) to know if you are eligible for DI.

## If I pay into State Disability Insurance but don’t live in California, am I still eligible for benefits?

Yes, where you live does not affect your eligibility. You may still be eligible if your job is based in California and you pay into [State Disability Insurance](/en/disability/) (noted as CASDI on your paystub).

## If I quit my job or am laid off and now I have a disability, can I file for disability benefits?

You must be working or looking for work at the time your disability begins. View our [complete list of eligibility requirements](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_DI_Benefits/) to learn more. If you aren’t sure if you’re eligible, file a claim anyway.

## I work more than one job. Will I get benefits that cover all my jobs?

Yes. If all of your employers take [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/) out of your paychecks, your Disability Insurance benefits will reflect all jobs. This will be listed as CASDI on your paystubs. Report all employment [on your application form when you apply](/en/disability/apply/) by listing the name, address, telephone number, and last day you worked for each employer.

## Do I have to be working at my job for a certain amount of time to be eligible for disability benefits?

No. Eligibility is based on the earnings shown in your base period. Your base period is wages you earned 5 to 18 months before your disability claim begins.

## As a farmworker, pesticide exposure presents a risk to my baby or my health during pregnancy. Can I file for Disability Insurance benefits?

Yes. Health care providers may certify a patient as disabled for State Disability Insurance benefits if the patient’s job requirements pose a danger to the health of a pregnant patient or the fetus.

## Can I receive Disability Insurance and Unemployment Insurance benefits at the same time?

If you are granted this exemption, you will not be eligible to receive SDI benefits.

## Are government workers eligible for disability benefits?

Some government workers, including school employees, may be eligible for Disability Insurance benefits. To find out, review your collective bargaining contract. If you have wages from another employer in your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/), you may be eligible even though your current employer doesn’t participate in State Disability Insurance. If you aren’t sure if you’re eligible, file a claim anyway.

## Are school employees eligible for Disability Insurance benefits during school breaks?

School employees are not eligible for Disability Insurance benefits if:

* Full wages were or will be paid to the employee during the contract period when services were performed.
* A period of disability overlaps with a school break and the employee is not scheduled to work, does not have a history of working during the break, or does not have an additional employer.
* The disability period extends through the school break period.

However, if the employee is not receiving wages but would have been working for extra income if not disabled (such as teaching summer school classes, tutoring, or other secondary job), then the employee may be eligible for benefits to replace the additional income.

## Will benefits cover an elective or cosmetic surgery?

Yes. Elective and cosmetic surgeries are covered by [Disability Insurance](/en/disability/disability_insurance/). Your licensed health professional must certify that you are unable to do your normal or usual job duties because of the surgery.

## Can I receive benefits if my employer is going to pay me vacation, sick, or holiday pay during my claim?

Disability Insurance Certifications and Continued Medical FAQs https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/faqs-certifications-continued-medical/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

### Can a doctor’s office charge me for filling out the Physician/Practitioner’s Certificate?

There is no law that prevents a licensed health professional from charging you to complete a Disability Insurance form.

### Can my treating nurse practitioner or physician assistant certify my claim for Disability Insurance benefits?

Yes. A nurse practitioner or physician assistant can certify for all medical conditions within their scope of practice. However, to certify to a disability other than normal pregnancy and childbirth, the nurse practitioner or physician assistant must perform a physical examination and collaborate with a physician and/or surgeon.

### What is the *Disability Claim Continued Eligibility Questionnaire* (DE 2593)?

If your claim is on automatic payment, after 10 weeks of payment, you will receive a *Disability Claim Continued Eligibility Questionnaire* (DE 2593). Return the form to the EDD either by mail or through your [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) account to certify that your disability continues. If you do not return the DE 2593 within 20 days after receiving the form, your benefits will stop. If this form is submitted late, you may lose benefits.

For more information, visit [Disability Insurance – Stop or Continue Your Benefits](/en/disability/Discontinue_Continue_or_Extend_Your_DI_Benefits/).

### What is the *Claim for Continued Disability Benefits* (DE 2500A) form?

If your claim is not on automatic payment, you will receive a *Claim for Continued Disability Benefits* (DE 2500A), also called a “continued claim certification,” every two weeks. By signing and dating the form, you certify that during the dates shown on the DE 2500A your disability continues and you have not recovered and/or returned to work. This is your request to continue your disability benefits.

If you do not return the DE 2500A to the EDD using your SDI Online account or by mail within 20 days after receiving the form, your benefits will stop. If this form is submitted late, you may lose benefits.

For more information, visit [Disability Insurance – Stop or Continue Your Benefits](/en/disability/Discontinue_Continue_or_Extend_Your_DI_Benefits/).

### How do I complete the DE 2500A?

To continue your benefits or if you recovered or returned to work part or full time:

* Mark the appropriate boxes and provide the correct date in Section 1.
* Provide wage or workers’ compensation information in Section 2.
* Complete Section 3 if your address or telephone number have changed.
* Sign and date Section 4.

Return the form within 20 days of the ending date shown on the form or 20 days after you receive the form if the ending date has passed or you may lose benefits. Do not return the form before the ending date or you may not receive the correct benefit payment.

### Can I send the DE 2500A in early?

No. Return the DE 2500A on the date indicated after the end date, unless you have recovered from your disability or returned to work before that date. You can be paid only for the days up to the postmark date or the day before the signature date, whichever is earlier.

Remember, if you have recovered, returned to work, or are receiving money from any source, you must tell the EDD by filling in the appropriate areas on the continued claim certification form.

### How long after I send back the DE 2500A can I expect a benefit payment?

Normally, benefit payments are issued within 10 days after we receive a completed continued claim certification.

### What should I do if I received a notice that says I will be issued my final Disability Insurance payment, but I have not recovered from my disability?

 The EDD can issue benefits only up until the date your licensed health professional confirms your disability.

In the same envelope as your *Electronic Benefit Payment (EBP) Notification*(DE 2500E), you should also receive the *Physician/Practitioner’s Supplementary Certificate*(DE 2525XX). You may also receive these forms through your [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) account inbox.

If your disability will continue beyond the original medical recovery date on your claim, have your license health professional complete and submit the DE 2525XX and send it to the address shown on the form. If your licensed health professional has an SDI Online account, they may search for this form using your last name and Claim ID number or last four digits of your Social Security number, date of birth, and last name to submit online. If you did not receive the DE 2525XX, contact the EDD by calling 1-800-480-3287 for further information.

**Note:** It may be necessary to send some documents via U.S. mail even if you selected electronic communication as your preference.

### What can I do if I have not recovered from my disability, but my licensed health professional will not sign the *Physician/Practitioner’s Supplementary Certificate* (DE 2525XX)?

If you feel you cannot return to work performing your regular or customary job duties, you should discuss it with your licensed health professional. You may also seek the opinion of another licensed health professional. If the new licensed health professional medically determines that you are not recovered from your disability, they can certify to extending your disability medical claim. Your licensed health professional can complete the DE 2525XX using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) or the paper form. If you lost or misplaced your DE 2525XX, you may [contact the EDD](/en/disability/Contact_SDI/)to get another DE 2525XX sent to you for them to complete.

Disability Insurance – Benefits and Payments FAQs https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/faqs-benefits-payments/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Get answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) we receive about Disability Insurance (DI) benefits and payments.

If you think you’re eligible for disability benefits, [file a claim to apply](/en/disability/apply/).

## How do you calculate what my weekly benefit amount for Disability Insurance will be?

We will calculate your weekly benefit amount using a [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/). This base period covers 12 months and is divided into four consecutive quarters of three months each.

Your weekly benefit amount is about 60 to 70 percent (depending on income) of wages earned 5 to 18 months before your claim start date, up to the maximum weekly benefit amount. You must have been paying SDI taxes on these wages (usually noted as CASDI on your paystub). Your base period does not include wages paid at the time your disability begins.

You can get a general estimate of your weekly benefit amount using our [Weekly Benefit Calculator](/en/disability/PFL_Calculator/). This calculator should be used as an estimate only.

## How soon will I receive my first benefit payment after I submit my completed claim form?

Most benefit payments are issued within two weeks after we receive a properly completed claim [online](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_in_sdi_online/) or [by mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/). By submitting your application completely and verifying that all information is correct, you help make sure your benefit payment is issued more quickly.

## Can I choose how I receive my benefit payment?

Yes. You can choose how you receive [your benefit payment](/en/about_edd/your-benefit-payment-options/) when you file your claim. Your options are:

* Direct deposit (SDI Online claims only)
* Debit card
* Check

## I got my first benefit payment. Why wasn’t I paid for the first seven days?

The first seven days of every new claim is a non-payable waiting period. The first payable day is the eighth day of your claim. Review the step-by-step overview for the [DI Claim Process](/en/disability/DI_Claim_Process/) to learn more.

If you are eligible, the EDD processes and issues payments within a few weeks of receiving a claim.

## I received my *Notice of Computation* (DE 429D). Why haven’t I received a benefit payment?

This notice does **not** confirm that you are eligible to receive benefits.

We send you the *Notice of Computation* (DE 429D) to let you know your potential weekly and maximum benefit amount based on the wages you earned in your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/). We may need more information before making a decision about your eligibility.

## My physician/practitioner says I will be unable to work for more than a year. How long can I collect Disability Insurance benefits?

You can collect up to 52 weeks of full Disability Insurance (DI) benefits, or the amount of wages in your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/), whichever is less. You may be paid for periods longer than 52 weeks if your benefits are reduced because you returned to work on a part-time basis, or if you received other money during your disability claim period. You can contact the [Social Security Administration](http://www.ssa.gov/) if your disability extends beyond what DI allows.

## Can my base period or my Weekly Benefit Amount (WBA) change throughout my claim?

No. Once your claim starts, your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) and your [Disability Insurance (DI)](/en/disability/disability_insurance/) weekly benefit amount stay the same.

## Do I need to report my Disability Insurance benefits for tax purposes?

No, your [Disability Insurance (DI)](/en/disability/disability_insurance/) benefits are not reportable for tax purposes. However, if you are receiving [Unemployment Insurance (UI)](/en/unemployment/) benefits, become unable to work due to a disability, and begin receiving DI benefits, a portion of your DI benefits will  be reported for tax purposes.

If this happens, we will send you a notice with your first benefit payment. This notice will tell you that your benefits are being reported to the IRS. In January we will provide you with a [1099G form](/en/unemployment/Get_Tax_Information_Form_1099G/) showing the reportable amounts paid (no more than your original UI maximum). We will also send a copy of the 1099G to the IRS.

## Can I receive Disability Insurance and Social Security Disability at the same time?

Yes, however, [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/) may reduce the amount you receive for [Disability Insurance](/en/disability/disability_insurance/) benefits.

For more information, review [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/).

## What changes must I report to the EDD when I am receiving benefits?

You must report in writing or [contact us](/en/disability/Contact_SDI/) immediately if you:

* Have returned to part-time or full-time work.
* Have recovered from your disability.
* Have received any wages.
* Need to report a date of death for a deceased claimant.

It is important to [report your wages](/en/disability/Reporting_Your_Wages_DI/) to:

* Receive the correct benefit amount.
* Prevent an [overpayment](/en/claims/Benefit-Overpayments/).

If you don’t report your income or a change in work status, you could receive an overpayment, penalties, and a false statement disqualification.

## What happens if I don’t notify the EDD of wages or changes like returning to work?

You must [report the wages](/en/disability/Reporting_Your_Wages_DI/) you received or changes to your status like returning to work, or you could face an [overpayment](/en/claims/Benefit-Overpayments/). This happens when you receive benefits you were not eligible for and has serious consequences.

For more information, review [FAQs – Benefit Overpayments](/en/claims/FAQ-Benefit-Overpayments/).

## How do I report a return-to-work date?

If you have recovered or returned to work, notify us immediately by using your SDI Online account, by mail, or by calling the Disability Insurance office at 1-800-480-3287.

For more information, visit [Continue or Stop Your Benefits](/en/disability/Discontinue_Continue_or_Extend_Your_DI_Benefits/).

## Can my employer terminate me while I am on Paid Family Leave?

We have no control over issues involving wages, hours of work, or conditions of employment.

You can contact the [Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) or [Civil Rights Department](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/), who has responsibility over employment and leave issues, including employment termination during a family leave.

## If I am terminated, will it affect my benefits?

No. Termination will not interfere with your benefits as long as you continue to meet the other eligibility requirements.

## My health benefits stopped while I was on Paid Family Leave. What can I do?

The [US Department of Labor (DOL)](https://www.dol.gov/) provides a temporary extension of health benefits at group rates for certain former employees through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) program. For more information, contact the DOL at 1-866-275-7922. For TTY, use 1-877-889-5627.

## How do I stop benefits for a deceased claimant?

There are two ways you can notify us of the deceased claimant’s date of death to [stop their benefit payments](/en/disability/Discontinue_Continue_or_Extend_Your_DI_Benefits/):

* **Phone:** Call us at 1-800-480-3287.
* **Mail:** Use the PO Box address printed on the payment notice.

If eligible, benefits are payable through the date of death. We will need the following information to stop benefit payments and contact you with additional instructions:

* Claimant’s full name
* Claimant’s date of death
* Your full name
* Your address
* Your phone number

## How do I pay an overpayment?

First, you must have received your billing notice. *Benefit Overpayment Statement of Amount Due* (DE 8301R) is a notice that is mailed to you each month. If you have not yet received this notice or have lost it, contact us at 1-800-480-3287.

It is important to repay a benefit overpayment as soon as possible to avoid collection and legal action. There are several [payment options](/en/claims/Benefit-Overpayments/) to repay a benefit overpayment, including using your [myEDD](/en/myedd/) account.

For more information, review [*Make a Payment on a Benefit Overpayment* (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEzO4aKxUa4&feature=youtu.be) or review [FAQs – Benefit Overpayments](/en/claims/FAQ-Benefit-Overpayments/).

## I am expecting my first benefit payment, but have not received it yet. What should I do?

If you have not received your payment and it has been more than 10 days since you received notice of payment, [contact us](/en/disability/Contact_SDI/).

## I just found an old State Disability Insurance check that I forgot to deposit. Can I still cash it?

Checks are valid for one year. If your check has expired, [contact us](/en/disability/Contact_SDI/) for benefit payment instructions.

## Can I pick up my State Disability Insurance benefit payment at the local office?

No. Benefit payments are not issued from our local offices. Benefit payments are sent electronically or by mail only.

## Can I remove the child support deduction from my Disability Insurance benefit payment?

No, we will not accept any documents directly from you related to court-ordered child support payments. All court orders to begin or end child support obligations are submitted to us through [California Child Support Services](https://childsupport.ca.gov/).

Contact the [Child Support Services](https://childsupport.ca.gov/find-my-local-agency/) office nearest you for any questions.

## I was receiving Unemployment Insurance benefits but now I have a disability. Can I receive benefits for Disability Insurance?

Yes, you can receive Disability Insurance (DI) benefits, but you cannot continue receiving Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits. If your physician/practitioner certifies that your disability prevents you from working, you can file a claim for [DI benefits](/en/disability/disability_insurance/). To end your UI benefits, simply stop certifying for unemployment and [contact us](/en/unemployment/contact_ui/) to suspend your unemployment benefits. We will schedule a phone interview with you so that you can begin receiving DI benefits.

------- @NONACCORDION:
Get answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) we receive about Disability Insurance (DI) benefits and payments.

If you think you’re eligible for disability benefits, [file a claim to apply](/en/disability/apply/).

------- @ACCORDIONS:

---- ## How do you calculate what my weekly benefit amount for Disability Insurance will be?:

We will calculate your weekly benefit amount using a [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/). This base period covers 12 months and is divided into four consecutive quarters of three months each.

Your weekly benefit amount is about 60 to 70 percent (depending on income) of wages earned 5 to 18 months before your claim start date, up to the maximum weekly benefit amount. You must have been paying SDI taxes on these wages (usually noted as CASDI on your paystub). Your base period does not include wages paid at the time your disability begins.

You can get a general estimate of your weekly benefit amount using our [Weekly Benefit Calculator](/en/disability/PFL_Calculator/). This calculator should be used as an estimate only.

---- ## How soon will I  receive my first benefit payment after I submit my completed claim form?:

Most benefit payments are issued within two weeks after we receive a properly completed claim [online](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_in_sdi_online/) or [by mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_di_claim_by_mail/). By submitting your application completely and verifying that all information is correct, you help make sure your benefit payment is issued more quickly.

---- ## Can  I choose how I receive my benefit payment?:

Yes. You can choose how you receive [your benefit payment](/en/about_edd/your-benefit-payment-options/) when you file your claim. Your options are:

* Direct deposit (SDI Online claims only)
* Debit card
* Check

---- ## I  got my first benefit payment. Why wasn’t I paid for the first seven days?:

The first seven days of every new claim is a non-payable waiting period. The first payable day is the eighth day of your claim. Review the step-by-step overview for the [DI Claim Process](/en/disability/DI_Claim_Process/) to learn more.

If you are eligible, the EDD processes and issues payments within a few weeks of receiving a claim.

---- ## I received my:

This notice does **not** confirm that you are eligible to receive benefits.

We send you the *Notice of Computation* (DE 429D) to let you know your potential weekly and maximum benefit amount based on the wages you earned in your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/). We may need more information before making a decision about your eligibility.

---- ## My  physician/practitioner says I will be unable to work for more than a year. How long  can I collect Disability Insurance benefits?:

You can collect up to 52 weeks of full Disability Insurance (DI) benefits, or the amount of wages in your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/), whichever is less. You may be paid for periods longer than 52 weeks if your benefits are reduced because you returned to work on a part-time basis, or if you received other money during your disability claim period. You can contact the [Social Security Administration](http://www.ssa.gov/) if your disability extends beyond what DI allows.

---- ## Can my base  period or my Weekly Benefit Amount (WBA) change throughout my claim?:

No. Once your claim starts, your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) and your [Disability Insurance (DI)](/en/disability/disability_insurance/) weekly benefit amount stay the same.

---- ## Do  I need to report my Disability Insurance benefits for tax purposes?:

No, your [Disability Insurance (DI)](/en/disability/disability_insurance/) benefits are not reportable for tax purposes. However, if you are receiving [Unemployment Insurance (UI)](/en/unemployment/) benefits, become unable to work due to a disability, and begin receiving DI benefits, a portion of your DI benefits will  be reported for tax purposes.

If this happens, we will send you a notice with your first benefit payment. This notice will tell you that your benefits are being reported to the IRS. In January we will provide you with a [1099G form](/en/unemployment/Get_Tax_Information_Form_1099G/) showing the reportable amounts paid (no more than your original UI maximum). We will also send a copy of the 1099G to the IRS.

---- ## Can I receive Disability Insurance and Social Security Disability at the same time?:

Yes, however, [Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/) may reduce the amount you receive for [Disability Insurance](/en/disability/disability_insurance/) benefits.

For more information, review [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/).

---- ## What  changes must I report to the EDD when I am receiving benefits?:

You must report in writing or [contact us](/en/disability/Contact_SDI/) immediately if you:

* Have returned to part-time or full-time work.
* Have recovered from your disability.
* Have received any wages.
* Need to report a date of death for a deceased claimant.

It is important to [report your wages](/en/disability/Reporting_Your_Wages_DI/) to:

* Receive the correct benefit amount.
* Prevent an [overpayment](/en/claims/Benefit-Overpayments/).

If you don’t report your income or a change in work status, you could receive an overpayment, penalties, and a false statement disqualification.

# FAQs - Paid Family Leave Eligibility

Show All

## [Am I eligible for Paid Family Leave?](#collapse-e863247d-e991-4f82-9e9d-627d10f48150)

You may be eligible for Paid Family Leave if you:

* Are a part-time or full-time employee of the public or private sector who has contributed to the State Disability Insurance program or a [self-employed Californian](/en/disability/Self-Employed/)who has contributed to the Disability Insurance Elective Coverage Program at some point during the previous 18 months.
* Have a loss of wages because you need to take time off work to care for a seriously ill family member, bond with a new child, or participate in a family member’s qualifying military event.

Visit [Eligibility Requirements](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_PFL_Benefits/) to learn more.

## [If I pay into State Disability Insurance but I don’t live in California, am I still eligible for benefits?](#collapse-7d2ad071-dc02-4a37-b238-d04caccadf8f)

Yes. Where you live does not affect your eligibility.

## [Can I receive Paid Family Leave benefits while working part-time?](#collapse-5a600e3f-4138-4f3e-a35e-c8a847bcc06d)

Yes. To use Paid Family Leave benefits intermittently while working part time, check “yes” to question A13 on the *Claim for Paid Family Leave Benefits* (DE 2501F) form or “yes” to question 6 on the *Claim for Paid Family Leave (Paid Family Leave ) Benefits – New Mother* (DE 2501FP) form. If filing online, check “yes” to the question, “Will you work at any time during your family leave?” You should also attach a detailed note to your claim form explaining which days you will work and the number of hours to be worked each day.

## [If I voluntarily quit my job to care for an ill family member, can I receive Paid Family Leave (PFL)?](#collapse-d3011dff-982d-469a-9d44-b2fcd8bfcbb1)

Yes, if you voluntarily quit your job to care for a family member with a serious health condition, you can receive PFL if you are eligible and submit a timely claim.

To be eligible, you must have paid into the State Disability Insurance Fund during your base period, and you must experience a wage loss because of your need to care for your seriously ill parent, child, spouse, registered domestic partner, sibling, parent-in-law, grandchild, or grandparent.  You also must be attached to the labor market before your PFL claim, which means 90 days before the start of your PFL claim. You must be employed, looking or registered for work, or have an active Unemployment Insurance or Disability Insurance claim. You will need to provide a medical certification documenting your family member’s illness. Find more information about eligibility requirements and how to apply [here](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_PFL_Benefits/).

## [Can I receive both Paid Family Leave (PFL) and Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits after I voluntarily quit my job due to caregiving responsibilities?](#collapse-719f3893-9357-45b5-9959-5dbae94ac94f)

Yes, but not at the same time. If you voluntarily quit your job to care for an ill family member, you should first apply for PFL benefits (see FAQ above.) If you are still unemployed after your final PFL benefit payment, you can then apply for unemployment benefits as long as you are still out of work, ready and available to accept work, and otherwise eligible for UI. 

To be eligible for UI, you will have to show “good cause” for voluntarily quitting work due to compelling caregiving responsibilities. This means you had a compelling caregiving responsibility that caused you to quit your job and you took reasonable steps to preserve your job before quitting.  Compelling caregiving responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

* A member of your family is seriously ill, disabled, or in danger of death.
* You need to move to care for a family member who is seriously ill or disabled, making it impossible or impractical for you to commute to work.
* You need to attend a funeral, make final arrangements, or attend to the final affairs of a member of your family who has died.
* A member of your family is elderly and unable to care for their self.
* Your minor child requires care/supervision and there is no reasonable alternative.
* There is a need to preserve family unity.

To establish “good cause,” you will also have to show that you quit your job for a compelling reason (e.g., quit to take care of a family member and no one else was available to provide care). Additionally, before quitting, you will also need to show you took reasonable steps to preserve your job—meaning, you first asked your employer for a leave of absence, accommodation, or transfer that would have allowed you to keep your job and care for your family member.  If you attempted to preserve your job by asking for a leave of absence, accommodation, or transfer, but your employer did not have these options available, this would still demonstrate you attempted to preserve your employment before quitting.

## [Can I opt out of the Paid Family Leave program?](#collapse-99bd6c38-2417-49ad-8355-b4e6f894969b)

No. The State Disability Insurance (SDI) program and contributions are mandatory under the California Unemployment Insurance Code.

There are two exceptions:

* If your employer or a majority of employees in your company apply for approval of a Voluntary Plan in place of SDI coverage. For more information visit: [Voluntary Plan Information](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/).
* If you adhere to the faith or teaching of a bona fide religious sect, denomination, or organization whose creed, tenets, or principles require dependence on prayer for healing you may request an exemption. Complete and mail the [*Religious Exemption Certificate* (DE 5067)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de5067.pdf) to the address on the form. If you are granted this exemption, you will not be eligible to receive SDI benefits.

## [When can I begin receiving Paid Family Leave benefits?](#collapse-510718b9-ddaf-4f47-88e4-1fe998314059)

The EDD makes every effort to process your Paid Family Leave (PFL) payment within 14 days of receiving your complete initial claim. Your employer may require that you use up to two weeks of vacation leave or paid time off (PTO) prior to receiving Paid Family Leave benefits. Paid Family Leave benefits can start immediately after your vacation leave/PTO ends.

## [What constitutes a serious health condition for the purposes of Paid Family Leave?](#collapse-e7919845-da29-4514-86f7-55d65740c694)

A serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care in a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility, or at home. This includes any period of incapacity (e.g., inability to work, attend school, or perform other regular daily activities) or any subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care; or continuing treatment by a physician or practitioner.

Unless complications arise, cosmetic treatments, the common cold, influenza, earaches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, and headaches other than migraines, are examples of conditions that do not meet the definition of a serious health condition for the purposes of Paid Family Leave.

## [A Nurse Practitioner or Physician Assistant is treating my care recipient. Can the treating Nurse Practitioner or Physician Assistant certify my claim for Paid Family Leave Benefits?](#collapse-d18ac875-2efe-4121-9239-5357ded8f0fe)

Yes. A Nurse Practitioner or Physician Assistant can certify for all medical conditions within their scope of practice after they have performed a physical examination and collaborated with a physician and/or surgeon.

## [I have accrued employer-provided sick leave, vacation time, and/or PTO. Do I have to take this leave before becoming eligible for and/or applying for Paid Family Leave?](#collapse-1c077283-192c-4aa7-b023-cb10a0480905)

Not necessarily. Your employer may require you to take up to two weeks of unused vacation leave and/or PTO before receiving Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits, but you should check with your human resources department first, since all employers are different. That said, your employer cannot require you to use sick leave before receiving PFL benefits.

You may be able to take unused sick leave and receive PFL benefits at the same time, but the combined benefits cannot exceed 100 percent of your regular earnings or your PFL benefits will be reduced by the amount of sick leave wages received. For more information about coordinating PFL with sick leave, DI, or other benefits, visit the [FAQs – Integration/Coordination of SDI Benefits](/en/disability/faq_integration_coordination/) page.

## [Am I eligible for Paid Family Leave benefits if I care for a family member that is out-of-state or out-of-the-country?](#collapse-c87a9a67-6b29-46c2-8e18-e1d5b42d54d7)

Yes. The care recipient’s treating physician/practitioner must provide medical certification establishing a need for care.

## [Can more than one family member apply for military assist benefits for the same military family member and event?](#collapse-f60cc7e2-7dcd-4aa5-b57d-37fe9619114b)

Yes. More than one family member can file a claim to assist for the same event if the two claims are for different time periods and do not overlap.

However, more than one individual cannot be eligible for benefits at the same time for the same military family member and the same military event.

## [Can more than one family member apply for military assist benefits for different qualifying events?](#collapse-89562249-c3f8-4285-8f4e-c32c0dd768ec)

Yes. Eligible family members can file a Paid Family Leave claim for different qualifying events at the same time.

**For example:**The father files a claim to attend the military ceremony and the mother files a claim to handle childcare during the same period of time.

## [Can workers with multiple family members serving in the military qualify for benefits to assist them in the same 12-month period?](#collapse-9f0f54cd-0c5a-4668-bfd8-4c6669e9010e)

A family member can file for benefits to assist **more than one** actively serving military family members for any qualifying event for up to eight weeks total during the same 12-month period. However, the family member must provide new military documentation each time the military member being assisted changes.

## [Are school employees eligible for Paid Family Leave benefits during school breaks?](#collapse-c034113b-2ea0-405d-be32-47a952abdf87)

School employees are not eligible for Paid Family Leave benefits if:

* Full wages were or will be paid to the employee during the contract period when services were performed.
* A period of family leave overlaps with a school break and the employee is not scheduled to work, does not have a history of working during the break, or does not have an additional employer.
* The family leave period extends through the school break period.

However, if the employee is not receiving wages but would have been working for extra income if not on family leave (such as teaching summer school classes, tutoring, or other secondary job), then the employee may be eligible for benefits to replace the additional income.

State Disability Insurance for State Employees FAQs https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/faq_di_state_employees/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

State Disability Insurance (SDI) includes both Disability Insurance (DI) and Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits.

## Who administers SDI?

The EDD administers SDI, the State Controller’s Office calculates and withholds the deductions, and the California Department of Human Resources is responsible for the contract administration.

## Can I use leave credits while receiving SDI benefits?

You can use 40 hours of accrued leave credits per month while receiving SDI, which includes both DI and PFL benefits. Also, you can use accrued vacation, annual leave, Compensatory Time Off, holiday credit, personal leave, or sick leave balances to cover the DI non-payable waiting period.

## Am I eligible for PFL benefits under SDI?

Yes. PFL provides benefits for those who need time off work to care for a seriously ill family member, bond with a new child, or participate in a qualifying event because of a family member’s military deployment to a foreign country.

For more information, visit [Am I Eligible for Paid Family Leave Benefits?](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_PFL_Benefits/)

## If I am employed by the State of California but live and work in another state, am I covered by SDI?

Yes. If you are in a covered bargaining unit and are otherwise eligible for SDI, you can file claims and receive benefits.

## Where can I find additional information about SDI, such as eligibility, benefit amounts, and claim filing?

For more information, visit [State Disability Insurance](/en/disability/) and select **Disability Insurance** or **Paid Family Leave**.

## If I am unable to work and receive DI or PFL benefits concurrently with the Family and Medical Leave Act or California Family Rights Act, what happens to my health benefits?

If you are unable to work due to a non-work-related disability or family leave and are receiving SDI benefits, your employer will pay their portion of the health benefits premium for up to 26 weeks. The State Controller’s Office will set up an accounts receivable for your portion of the health benefits premium to be paid when you return to work.

If you coordinate benefits, you have the option to have your portion of your health benefits premium paid instead of paying the premiums back later with an accounts receivable.

If you are out under the Family and Medical Leave Act, which runs concurrently with SDI and you have not returned to work after 26 weeks, in order to continue your health benefits, you will be required to pay the provider for both the employee and employer share of the premium.

## Do managers and supervisors receive SDI benefits?

No. Managers and supervisors may be eligible to participate in the [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance](/en/disability/nonindustrial/) program (both the regular and enhanced benefit levels).

## Are DI and PFL benefits reportable for tax purposes?

Your DI benefits are not reportable for tax purposes with one exception. If you are receiving Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits, become unable to work due to a disability, and begin receiving DI benefits, your DI benefits are substituted for your UI benefits and will be reportable for tax purposes.

If DI benefits are reportable, a notice with the first benefit payment will be sent to you explaining that the benefits are being reported to the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In January, we will provide you with a 1099G form showing the reportable amounts paid (no more than the original UI maximum) and forward a copy of the 1099G to the IRS.

PFL benefits are reportable for federal purposes but not for California state tax purposes. We will provide you with a 1099G form and forward a copy of the 1099G to the IRS.

## Are SDI deductions pre-taxed (deducted from my paycheck before paying federal, state, and social security taxes)?

No. SDI deductions are not pre-taxed.

## If my spouse has health benefit coverage and I am receiving the cash option under FlexElect, will I be allowed to reenroll in the cash option after returning from leave?

Yes. Your FlexElect Cash Option will resume automatically once you return from leave.

**Note:** FlexElect is currently suspended under PLP 2020.

## How will annual leave credits be accrued for employees on SDI?

If you are receiving SDI benefits, you will not accrue annual leave credits unless you work partial hours.

## Will an SDI deduction be taken from a lump-sum payment that is being transferred to my 401(k) plan?

No. Lump sum payments for pay (e.g., vacation, annual leave, Compensatory Time Off) that were earned but not paid for services performed prior to termination of employment will not be considered wages or compensation for personal services. So there should be no SDI deductions withheld from lump sum payments. This includes lump sum payments for vacation cash out or 401(k) plans.

## Can I choose to participate in either SDI or Nonindustrial Disability Insurance/Enhanced Nonindustrial Insurance?

No. You cannot choose your disability program. It is determined by your employment position and bargaining unit.

SDI covers employees in bargaining units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21.

[Nonindustrial Disability Insurance](/en/disability/nonindustrial/) covers excluded employees and rank-and-file employees in bargaining units 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, and 19.

## If I move to a bargaining unit not covered by SDI, what happens to my SDI deductions? Am I eligible for both Nonindustrial Disability Insurance and SDI?

The SDI deductions stop. The funds are not returned to you. You could potentially be eligible for both [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance](/en/disability/nonindustrial/) and SDI if you have wages in your base period.

## Can I buy back service credits for retirement during the time I received Nonindustrial Disability Insurance or SDI?

Contact CalPERS to discuss your service credit purchase options. Call toll-free at 1-888-CalPERS (or 1-888-225-7377) Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. For TTY, use 1-877-249-7442.

------- @NONACCORDION:
State Disability Insurance (SDI) includes both Disability Insurance (DI) and Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits.

------- @ACCORDIONS:

---- ## Who administers SDI?:

The EDD administers SDI, the State Controller’s Office calculates and withholds the deductions, and the California Department of Human Resources is responsible for the contract administration.

---- ## Can I use leave credits while receiving SDI benefits?:

You can use 40 hours of accrued leave credits per month while receiving SDI, which includes both DI and PFL benefits. Also, you can use accrued vacation, annual leave, Compensatory Time Off, holiday credit, personal leave, or sick leave balances to cover the DI non-payable waiting period.

---- ## Am I eligible for PFL benefits under SDI?:

Yes. PFL provides benefits for those who need time off work to care for a seriously ill family member, bond with a new child, or participate in a qualifying event because of a family member’s military deployment to a foreign country.

For more information, visit [Am I Eligible for Paid Family Leave Benefits?](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_PFL_Benefits/)

---- ## If I am employed by the State of California but live and work in another state, am I covered by SDI?:

Yes. If you are in a covered bargaining unit and are otherwise eligible for SDI, you can file claims and receive benefits.

---- ## Where can I find additional information about SDI, such as eligibility, benefit amounts, and claim filing?:

For more information, visit [State Disability Insurance](/en/disability/) and select **Disability Insurance** or **Paid Family Leave**.

---- ## If I am unable to work and receive DI or PFL benefits concurrently with the Family and Medical Leave Act or California Family Rights Act, what happens to my health benefits?:

If you are unable to work due to a non-work-related disability or family leave and are receiving SDI benefits, your employer will pay their portion of the health benefits premium for up to 26 weeks. The State Controller’s Office will set up an accounts receivable for your portion of the health benefits premium to be paid when you return to work.

If you coordinate benefits, you have the option to have your portion of your health benefits premium paid instead of paying the premiums back later with an accounts receivable.

If you are out under the Family and Medical Leave Act, which runs concurrently with SDI and you have not returned to work after 26 weeks, in order to continue your health benefits, you will be required to pay the provider for both the employee and employer share of the premium.

---- ## Do managers and supervisors receive SDI benefits?:

No. Managers and supervisors may be eligible to participate in the [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance](/en/disability/nonindustrial/) program (both the regular and enhanced benefit levels).

---- ## Are DI and PFL benefits reportable for tax purposes?:

Your DI benefits are not reportable for tax purposes with one exception. If you are receiving Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits, become unable to work due to a disability, and begin receiving DI benefits, your DI benefits are substituted for your UI benefits and will be reportable for tax purposes.

If DI benefits are reportable, a notice with the first benefit payment will be sent to you explaining that the benefits are being reported to the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In January, we will provide you with a 1099G form showing the reportable amounts paid (no more than the original UI maximum) and forward a copy of the 1099G to the IRS.

PFL benefits are reportable for federal purposes but not for California state tax purposes. We will provide you with a 1099G form and forward a copy of the 1099G to the IRS.

---- ## Are SDI deductions pre-taxed (deducted from my paycheck before paying federal, state, and social security taxes)?:

No. SDI deductions are not pre-taxed.

---- ## If my spouse has health benefit coverage and I am receiving the cash option under FlexElect, will I be allowed to reenroll in the cash option after returning from leave?:

Yes. Your FlexElect Cash Option will resume automatically once you return from leave.

**Note:** FlexElect is currently suspended under PLP 2020.

---- ## How will annual leave credits be accrued for employees on SDI?:

If you are receiving SDI benefits, you will not accrue annual leave credits unless you work partial hours.

---- ## Will an SDI deduction be taken from a lump-sum payment that is being transferred to my 401(k) plan?:

No. Lump sum payments for pay (e.g., vacation, annual leave, Compensatory Time Off) that were earned but not paid for services performed prior to termination of employment will not be considered wages or compensation for personal services. So there should be no SDI deductions withheld from lump sum payments. This includes lump sum payments for vacation cash out or 401(k) plans.

---- ## Can I choose to participate in either SDI or Nonindustrial Disability Insurance/Enhanced Nonindustrial Insurance?:

No. You cannot choose your disability program. It is determined by your employment position and bargaining unit.

SDI covers employees in bargaining units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21.

[Nonindustrial Disability Insurance](/en/disability/nonindustrial/) covers excluded employees and rank-and-file employees in bargaining units 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 18, and 19.

---- ## If I move to a bargaining unit not covered by SDI, what happens to my SDI deductions? Am I eligible for both Nonindustrial Disability Insurance and SDI?:

The SDI deductions stop. The funds are not returned to you. You could potentially be eligible for both [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance](/en/disability/nonindustrial/) and SDI if you have wages in your base period.

# Paid Family Leave Benefits and Payments FAQs

Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides working Californians up to eight weeks of partial pay to take time off work to care for a seriously ill family member, bond with a new child, or participate in a qualifying military event.

Show All

## [How much money can I receive through PFL?](#collapse-12df0ee5-1134-46fb-87d3-c53d2d3f19d2)

If eligible, you can receive about 60 to 70 percent (depending on income) of wages earned 5 to 18 months before your claim start date for up to 8 weeks within any 12-month period. The length of time worked at your current job does not affect eligibility.

To learn more, visit [Calculating Paid Family Leave Benefit Payment Amounts](/en/disability/Calculating_PFL_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) or use the [Weekly Benefit Amount Calculator](/en/disability/PFL_Calculator/) to estimate your benefit amount.

## [Can I choose how I receive my benefit payment?](#collapse-f585fdf6-aeae-44db-a81b-fb2b2a5e7f52)

Yes. You will choose how you receive [your benefit payments](/en/about_edd/your-benefit-payment-options/) when you file your claim. Your options are:

* Direct deposit (SDI Online claims only)
* Debit card
* Check

## [How soon will I receive my first benefit payment after I submit my completed claim form?](#collapse-587e3cd9-bb0f-4448-a2da-d12885cf5d8f)

Most benefit payments are issued within two weeks after the EDD receives a properly completed claim [online](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_pfl_claim_in_sdi_online/) or [by mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_pfl_claim_by_mail/). By filling in your application completely and verifying that all information is correct, you help ensure your benefit payment is issued promptly.

## [How long can I receive PFL benefits?](#collapse-19b11110-a7a4-41e5-a014-6d932e39793b)

You may receive PFL benefits for up to 8 weeks within any 12-month period for care, bonding, or military assist claims. You can break up your eight weeks. You don’t have to take PFL all at once. If you’re a parent taking time off work to bond with a child, you may only receive PFL benefits during the first year after your child’s birth, adoption, or foster care placement.

## [Who pays for PFL?](#collapse-92263e89-5f51-4d9d-b8de-f3a9463ffd4b)

PFL is funded by mandatory payroll deductions from covered workers. This means that your previous paychecks helped pay for your own benefits and the benefits of millions of other eligible Californians.

## [How do I apply for PFL?](#collapse-54be679e-f6ef-4f4b-b7ac-0b2d3ca93bb4)

You can apply for PFL by completing the *Claim for Paid Family Leave (PFL) Benefits* (DE 2501F) form online or by mail.

To apply online, you must first create an account with [myEDD](/en/bpo/) to access SDI Online. Visit the myEDD login page and select **Create Account**to get started. For more information, visit [How to File a PFL Claim in SDI Online](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_pfl_claim_in_sdi_online/).

myEDD registration is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

After you have created an account and logged back in to myEDD, select SDI Online, which will direct you to the **SDI Online** Registration page. Select your account type and complete the requested information. Once your SDI Online registration is complete, log in to myEDD again and select SDI Online once more to be directed to your **Home**page to file your claim.

**Note:** It may be necessary to send some documents via U.S. mail even if you selected electronic communication.

To apply by mail, visit [How to File a PFL Claim by Mail](/en/disability/how_to_file_a_pfl_claim_by_mail/).

For bonding claims, your application must include documentation showing the relationship between you and your new child (for example, a copy of the child’s birth certificate or record, adoptive placement agreement, or foster care placement record). 

**Note:** Mothers transitioning from a Disability Insurance pregnancy claim to a PFL bonding claim do not have to provide a proof of relationship document.

For caregiving claims, your application must also include a medical certification from your family member’s physician/practitioner and the care recipient’s or their authorized representative’s signature on the Statement of Care Recipient portion of the claim form.

For military assist claims, you must include supporting military documentation and documentation for the qualifying event.

## [My employer says they will terminate me if I don’t return to work. Does PFL protect me from losing my job?](#collapse-fd4a3abf-fbca-4403-97cf-fc41d1d08275)

No. PFL does not protect your job. It only provides paid benefits when you need time off work for family leave. However, your job may be protected through other laws, such as the federal [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](http://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla/)or the[California Family Rights Act (CFRA)](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/).

For more information, visit the [Family and Medical Leave Act and the California Family Rights Act FAQs](/en/disability/faqs-fmla-cfra/) page. You can also contact the Department of Labor at 1-866-487-2365 or the Civil Rights Department at 1-800-884-1684.

## [Can my employer terminate me while I am on Paid Family Leave?](#collapse-5aff13f3-248f-418a-86f1-7f453e9bbc7f)

We have no control over issues involving wages, hours of work, or conditions of employment.

You can contact the [Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) or the [Civil Rights Department](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/), which has responsibility over employment and leave issues, including employment termination during a family leave.

## [If I am terminated, will it affect my benefits?](#collapse-a064608f-f0fe-4357-970b-968846764267)

No. Termination will not interfere with your benefits as long as you continue to meet the other eligibility requirements.

## [My health benefits stopped while I was on Paid Family Leave. What can I do?](#collapse-7d2cae58-b6a7-4e28-b6d1-71424f2b229b)

The [U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)](https://www.dol.gov/) provides a temporary extension of health benefits at group rates for certain former employees through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) program. For more information, contact the DOL at 1-866-275-7922. For TTY, use 1-877-889-5627.

## [How long will it take for my claim to be processed?](#collapse-8a52b02d-028d-47b0-9712-76f179465140)

Your claim will be processed about 14 business days after the EDD receives your properly completed application.

## [When can I apply for PFL?](#collapse-4c9a27a1-cb1f-4bd7-bf18-5b6a84cb04dd)

All PFL claims must be completed and submitted no earlier than the first day your family leave begins but no later than 41 days after your first day of leave.

PFL benefits for bonding must be claimed within one year of your child’s birth, adoption, or foster care placement, so you should file your claim no later than eight to nine weeks before the anniversary of the child entering your family.

## [Can I receive Disability Insurance or Unemployment Insurance benefits while receiving PFL benefits?](#collapse-b30ddd03-4b4e-4146-bf6a-d1b931f8d494)

No. You may not receive Disability Insurance or Unemployment Insurance benefits for the same period in which PFL benefits are paid.

## [Can I receive workers’ compensation benefits while receiving PFL benefits?](#collapse-3febf127-720b-4406-b7b6-2909d9ccacb2)

Yes. If your workers’ compensation weekly benefit amount is less than your weekly PFL benefit amount, you may be eligible to receive the difference.

## [Will I have to pay taxes on PFL benefit payments?](#collapse-d937acd4-141d-4a8c-9b5d-ddaad4944ae1)

Yes. You will receive a 1099-G tax form in January of the following year you received benefits. For more information, visit the [FAQs - Form 1099G](/en/disability/SDI_FAQ_for_1099G/)page or contact the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/).

For state taxes, PFL benefit payments are not reportable by California pursuant to Revenue and Taxation Code Section 17083.

## [What must I report to the EDD when I am receiving benefits?](#collapse-bf2ceada-24f0-4164-b9ab-f64a9a52dff8)

You must report:

* If you have returned to part-time, intermittent, or full-time work.
* If you have stopped providing care, bonding, or participating in military events.
* The date of death of the care or bonding recipient.
* Any wages received. See [Reporting Your Wages](/en/disability/Reporting_Your_Wages_PFL/) for a complete list of wages to report.

Reporting this information ensures you receive the correct benefit amount and prevents an overpayment.

## [Can I start collecting unemployment benefits because I am laid off or have had my work hours reduced, and then switch to a PFL claim?](#collapse-b8d7a4bb-07d4-4051-9875-d7efda52b717)

Yes. If you have a family member who becomes sick while you are out of work, you can apply for a Paid Family Leave claim which can provide a higher benefit amount if you’re eligible. A medical certification is required to verify your family member’s illness. If you are approved for a Paid Family Leave claim, your Unemployment Insurance (UI) claim will be put on hold. If your Paid Family Leave claim ends and you are still unemployed, you may return to your UI claim benefits as long as you are still out of work and otherwise eligible. You will need to reapply to reopen your UI claim.

## [How do I report the death of a care or bonding recipient?](#collapse-08c8ea0f-3120-4d95-8d36-133b3bf8ed3d)

If the person you are caring for or the child you are bonding with passes away, report the death to the PFL office at 1-877-238-4373. You may also notify the EDD by writing to the PO Box address printed on the payment notice. Provide the care or bonding recipient’s name and date of death, and your name, address, and phone number so we can contact you with additional instructions. Benefits are payable through the date of death if otherwise eligible.

## [How do I pay for an overpayment?](#collapse-522f5e34-f914-42d8-8f83-ec8c5dc07a0c)

First, you must have received your billing notice. The *Benefit Overpayment Statement of Amount Due* (DE 8301R) form is a billing notice that is mailed to you each month. If you have not yet received this notice or have lost it, please contact the EDD at 1-877-238-4373.

Visit [Benefit Overpayments](/en/claims/Benefit-Overpayments/) to make a payment.

For more information, view [*Benefit Overpayment Services: Make a Payment* (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFEVyArBiNM).

## [If I misplaced a form the EDD mailed to me, how do I get a new one?](#collapse-91f30c85-eb4b-44d6-8298-06ec0d91f6b8)

If you misplaced a form, you can obtain a new one by:

* Calling 1-877-238-4373 (English) or 1-877-379-3819 (Spanish).
* Visiting [AskEDD](https://askedd.edd.ca.gov/):
	1. For category, select **PFL**.
	2. For sub-category, select **Miscellaneous Inquiry**.
	3. For topic, select **Other (Questions)**.

## [I’m on PFL and my employer says that I have to pay for my own health insurance. Is this correct?](#collapse-4ab6825f-cf93-4497-90cb-34df0ab47337)

The EDD does not have control over employer policies. PFL provides only partial wage replacement when you need to take time off work for family leave. You may have rights under other laws, such as the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla) or the [California Family Rights Act (CFRA)](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/).

For detailed information about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), visit the[Department of Labor](http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/index.htm) or call 1-866-487-2365.

For detailed information about the California Family Rights Act (CFRA), visit the [Civil Rights Department](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/) or call 1-800-884-1684.

## [Can I pay into PFL if I’m self-employed?](#collapse-0c7b10a4-5efd-4cf3-9e24-4a55aa4b70f5)

The EDD has a program for self-employed individuals and independent contractors called Disability Insurance Elective Coverage (DIEC). Premiums are based on the net profits you reported to the IRS on your Schedule SE for the previous tax year and are paid on a quarterly basis.

For more information, visit [Eligibility for DIEC](/en/disability/Self-Employed_Eligibility/).

## [My employer does not participate in State Disability Insurance. Is there a way I can participate?](#collapse-242f048a-556a-4dde-a438-46e9bbe7223c)

The California Unemployment Insurance Code exempts various groups from participating in the State Disability Insurance (SDI) program, which includes Disability Insurance and PFL. Among these are sole proprietors and partnerships with exempt employees, Indian tribes, and public entities, which include most government and school district employees. For groups such as these to be covered, they must apply for and elect SDI coverage.

Employees that fall within these exempt groups may not participate in SDI as an individual. Group participation is required. See the [*Information Sheet for Nonprofit and/or Public Entities* (DE 231NP) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de231np.pdf) and the [*Information Sheet for Specialized Coverage (Elective Coverage for Exempt Workers)* (DE 231SC) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de231sc.pdf).

## [Can I check the status of my PFL claim online?](#collapse-c35a59a2-daae-4f5b-8999-b702fbf410db)

No. PFL benefit information is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week using the [PFL Automated Telephone Information System](/en/disability/paid_family_leave_pfl_automated_phone_information_system/). You will need a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to access your information. You create your PIN using the automated telephone system.

Visit [Debit Card](/en/about_edd/your-benefit-payment-options/the_edd_debit_card/)for debit card benefit and contact information.

## [Can I remove the child support deduction from my Paid Family Leave benefit payment?](#collapse-50bc0e89-2a6b-4116-ae2e-b9488470fdd5)

No, we will not accept any documents directly from you related to court-ordered child support payments. All court orders to begin or end child support obligations are submitted to us through [California Child Support Services](https://childsupport.ca.gov/).

Contact the [California Child Support Services](https://childsupport.ca.gov/find-my-local-agency/) office nearest you for any questions.

### Disability Insurance (DI)

Your patient's disability must prevent them from doing their regular or customary work for at least eight days to be eligible for benefits. There is a seven-day, non-payable waiting period.

If a claim is filed for the same or related cause or condition within 60 days of the initial claim, it will be processed as a continuation of the initial claim. There will not be a new waiting period because the waiting period was already served.

### Paid Family Leave (PFL)

Your patient’s caregiver must file their claim within 41 days of their first day of family leave to be eligible for benefits. There is no waiting period for PFL claims.

Your patient’s caregiver must be unable to do their regular or customary work while caring for their seriously ill child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner for at least one day.

## My patient’s pregnancy-related complication will require them to stop working earlier than the four weeks before their estimated due date. Can they file for Disability Insurance benefits?

Yes. If it is not medically advisable for your patient to perform her regular or customary work, they may file for Disability Insurance benefits. You must submit the medical certification with a valid pregnancy-related diagnosis code for the complication.

## My patient’s job requirements pose a risk to the pregnant patient or the fetus. Can my patient file for Disability Insurance benefits?

Yes. If your patient’s job requirements (e.g., lifting, continuous standing, chemical exposure, etc.) pose a danger to the health of your pregnant patient or the fetus, they can file for Disability Insurance benefits. You must submit the medical certification with a valid pregnancy-related diagnosis code (for example, supervision of a normal pregnancy) and the applicable diagnosis code for the occupational hazard (for example, occupational exposure to toxic agents in agriculture or manufacturing).

## When can I certify a Paid Family Leave care claim?

Any eligible California worker who takes time off work to care for an ill family member may file a Paid Family Leave care claim. Family members include:

* Child
* Spouse
* Parent
* Parent-in-law
* Grandparent
* Grandchild
* Sibling

Care includes helping with medical needs, eating, self-care, transportation, or providing emotional support. Care also includes planning future care or providing relief for other care givers. You can provide medical certification for any of these reasons.

## Is there a time limit to file a claim for my patient or my patient's caregiver?

Yes. To receive timely payments, your patient or patient’s caregiver need you to promptly return a complete and accurate Physician/Practitioner’s Certificate. These certificates must be returned within 49 days from the date your patient’s disability begins or within 41 days from the date the caregiver’s family leave begins.

## What happens if I do not submit my medical certificate for my patient or patient's caregiver within the time limit?

If you delay in certifying the claim, you may cause benefits to be delayed, denied, or reduced for your patient or your patient's caregiver.

### Disability Insurance

For initial claims, you must submit the Physician/Practitioner’s Certificate within 49 days from the date their disability began. For continued claims, you must submit the medical extension (Physician/Practitioner’s Supplementary Certificate) within 20 days from the mailing or issue date.

### Paid Family Leave

For initial claims, you must submit the Physician/Practitioner’s Certificate within 41 days from the date their family leave began. For continued claims, you must submit the medical extension (Physician/Practitioner’s Supplementary Certificate) within 20 days from the mailing date.

## Will Disability Insurance benefits cover my patient for elective or cosmetic surgery?

Yes. Elective and cosmetic surgeries are covered if the patient meets the [eligibility requirements](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_PFL_Benefits/).

## Will Disability Insurance benefits cover my patient for substance abuse and/or addiction?

Yes. Benefits are payable for a limited period to a resident in an alcoholic recovery home or drug-free residential facility. The facility must be licensed and certified by the state in which the facility is located. Disabilities related to or caused by acute chronic alcoholism or drug abuse, which are being medically treated, do not have this limitation.

## How do I submit the medical certification for Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave claims?

You may submit medical certifications using [SDI Online](/en/disability/SDI_Online/) or by completing and mailing the paper claim form: *Claim for Disability Insurance (DI) Benefits* (DE 2501) or *Claim for Paid Family Leave (PFL) Benefits* (DE 2501F). For more information, visit [Certify and Manage Claims – Basics for Physicians/Practitioners](/en/disability/Basics_for_Physicians-Practitioners/).

## Can I charge my patients for completing the Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave forms?

Yes. There is no law that prevents you from charging your patient to complete Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave forms.

## How will my patient's documents and information be used?

We follow all Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), state, and federal laws in the handling of medical records and information for Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave claims.

## What are some tips for completing the claim forms?

Visit [Certify and Manage Claims – Basics for Physicians/Practitioners](/en/disability/Basics_for_Physicians-Practitioners/) for tips on how to fill out and submit claims.

Voluntary Plan FAQs https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/FAQ_Voluntary_Plans/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

Get answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) we receive about the [Voluntary Plan (VP)](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/).

## Employees

## My employer told me I was not eligible for State Disability Insurance benefits because I belong to a Voluntary Plan. What is that?

California law allows your employer to offer you a [Voluntary Plan (VP)](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/) for disability and family leave benefits in place of [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/) coverage. Your VP must provide all the benefits of SDI and at least one benefit that is better. It cannot cost you more than SDI.

Refer to [Voluntary Plan Claim Eligibility and Requirements](/en/disability/VP_Claim_Eligibility_Requirements/) for more information.

## Am I covered by a Voluntary Plan or State Disability Insurance? How do I file a Voluntary Plan claim?

Contact your employer’s personnel or benefits office for more information or to file a Voluntary Plan claim.

## Why did I receive a notice that my claim for State Disability Insurance benefits was referred to a Voluntary Plan? How long do I have to wait?

Your claim for [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/) benefits was referred to a [Voluntary Plan (VP)](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/) because there is a question of who your SDI provider is. The VP carrier has 25 days to respond to our referral. We will contact you after we receive their response, but we cannot pay you benefits during the 25-day period.

## If my Voluntary Plan stops paying benefits, can I receive State Disability Insurance?

No. You are covered under the [Voluntary Plan (VP)](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/) and are not eligible for State Disability Insurance.

## What should I do if I’m not covered by my employer’s Voluntary Plan?

If you’re not covered by your employer’s Voluntary Plan, your employer will refer your claim for benefits to [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/). Check with your employer to make sure your claim was referred.

## What can I do if my employer’s Voluntary Plan said I was covered but denied my benefits?

If your [Voluntary Plan](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/) denies disability or family leave benefits and you disagree, you can appeal the decision and have a hearing before an impartial administrative law judge. Your employer will provide a denial letter with your rights and instructions on how to appeal.

### Disability Insurance

Mail us a detailed letter stating why you think the VP denial is incorrect. Be sure to:

* Print and sign your name on the appeal letter.
* Include your Social Security number.
* Include your address and telephone number.
* Include your employer’s VP number.
* Explain the reason for appealing the decision.

We will file the appeal documents with the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board local Office of Appeals, but will not pay benefits during the appeal period or attend the hearing.

### Paid Family Leave

Complete an *Appeal for Determination of Coverage* (DE 1000DC). To request a copy of the DE 1000DC, [email the VP Group](mailto:VPProgram@edd.ca.gov) or call 1-916-653-6839. You will need to:

* Print and sign your name on the appeal letter.
* Include your Social Security number.
* Include your address and telephone number.
* Include your employer’s VP number.
* Include a brief factual statement of why the EDD should accept coverage.
* Attach a copy of the denial letter.

Send the appeal to your local Office of Appeals and a copy to the EDD office. For information on the Office of Appeals for your area, call SDI Customer Service at 1-916-653-6839.

You must attend your appeal hearing. If you do not attend, the appeal will be dismissed. For more information, visit [Filing an Appeal](/en/disability/appeals/).

## I filed a claim with my employer over a month ago and have not heard anything. What can I do?

Contact your employer’s human resources or third party administrator (TPA) to find out the reason for the delay. If you feel the reason is unsatisfactory, you can [file an appeal](/en/disability/appeals/) for presumed denial of benefits. Call us at 1-916-653-6839 for help with your appeal.

## I’m covered by a Voluntary Plan but received a *Notice of Computation* from State Disability Insurance. Is this the weekly amount I am going to receive?

State Disability Insurance provides this information to you and your employer to help determine your wages and benefit amount. The benefit amount on the *Notice of Computation – DI* (DE 429D) or *Notice of Computation – PFL* (DE 429DF) shows the minimum amount your employer’s plan must pay you.

## Can I receive benefits from both State Disability Insurance and a Voluntary Plan if I work for two employers who offer different coverage?

Yes. If you are working for two different employers, with one employer providing [State Disability Insurance (SDI)](/en/disability/) coverage and the other a [Voluntary Plan (VP)](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/), you can receive simultaneous coverage. Both companies are equally responsible for paying a portion of your benefit. But, you will not receive twice the normal benefit amount.

## Can I change coverage to State Disability Insurance if I’m covered by a Voluntary Plan?

Yes. Contact your employer’s human resources or third party administrator (TPA) for information on transferring coverage.

Disability Insurance Elective Coverage FAQs https://edd.ca.gov/en/disability/faq_elective_coverage/

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

We offer an optional [Disability Insurance Elective Coverage (DIEC)](/en/payroll_taxes/Disability_Insurance_Elective_Coverage/) program for employers, independent contractors, and self-employed people who don’t pay into State Disability Insurance (SDI) but want to be covered by Disability Insurance (DI) and Paid Family Leave (PFL).

## I just started paying into my DIEC plan. What is the waiting period before I can get my disability or family leave benefits?

Usually, you are eligible for benefits after participating in the DIEC program for at least six months from the approved start date of your plan.

However, if you worked as an employee in California for an employer who previously deducted SDI contributions 5 to 18 months before your DIEC plan, you may have wage earnings in your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/#baseperiod), which could give you a valid claim to begin your DI or PFL leave sooner.

## How are my weekly benefits calculated?

Benefits are based on the income credits during the four quarters of the base period of your claim, not on your actual earnings during those quarters. Income credits are based on net profit reported to the IRS on your tax forms up to four years prior, depending on the timing of your claim.  Please contact the DIEC Unit at 1-916-654-6288 if you have questions on income credits.

## I’m self-employed and I have DIEC. If I’m hurt on the job, will I receive DI benefits?

Yes. DIEC benefits are payable whether you are hurt on or off the job unless you carry [workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) coverage for yourself.

## If I’m collecting benefits under my DIEC plan and continue to receive income from my business, will SDI still pay me?

You may continue to receive income or profits from your business and still be eligible for either DI or PFL benefits. Learn more about eligibility requirements for:

* [Disability Insurance (DI)](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_DI_Benefits/)

## How do I pay my DIEC premiums?

You will receive a statement at the end of each quarter showing the amount due. Your premium or payment is due by the last day of the month following the end of the quarter.

## Do I still need to pay premiums if I have a disability or my family leave begins?

Yes. Premiums still need to be paid but may be adjusted for a full or partial quarter. For more information, contact your local [Employment Tax Office](/en/Office_Locator/).

## What happens if my premiums are not paid or I’m late paying them?

You have 30 days to submit your DIEC payment. If your DIEC plan is more than two years old and your premiums are not paid by the late date shown on your quarterly statement, you will receive a late notice and penalties and interest will be added. If payment, plus the penalty and interest, is not received within 30 days of the date shown on the late notice, your DIEC coverage may be canceled. If your plan is fewer than two years old, we may assess and collect the unpaid amount.

## I am late on my premiums and have just become unable to work due to a disability or need for family leave. Will I still receive benefits?

No. Benefits will not be paid if your DIEC account is late or unpaid.

## Can I cancel my DIEC?

After choosing DIEC, you must stay in the plan for two full calendar years. After that, you can cancel your coverage by submitting a request during the month of January. The EDD can also cancel your DIEC. Cancellation will be effective January 1.

To continue your EC eligibility, you must show a minimum profit of $4,600 per year. If your profits fall below this level for three consecutive years, the EDD may cancel your coverage.

------- @NONACCORDION:
We offer an optional [Disability Insurance Elective Coverage (DIEC)](/en/payroll_taxes/Disability_Insurance_Elective_Coverage/) program for employers, independent contractors, and self-employed people who don’t pay into State Disability Insurance (SDI) but want to be covered by Disability Insurance (DI) and Paid Family Leave (PFL).

------- @ACCORDIONS:

---- ## I just started paying into my DIEC plan. What is the waiting period before I can get my disability or family leave benefits?:

Usually, you are eligible for benefits after participating in the DIEC program for at least six months from the approved start date of your plan.

However, if you worked as an employee in California for an employer who previously deducted SDI contributions 5 to 18 months before your DIEC plan, you may have wage earnings in your [base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/#baseperiod), which could give you a valid claim to begin your DI or PFL leave sooner.

---- ## How are my weekly benefits calculated?:

Benefits are based on the income credits during the four quarters of the base period of your claim, not on your actual earnings during those quarters. Income credits are based on net profit reported to the IRS on your tax forms up to four years prior, depending on the timing of your claim.  Please contact the DIEC Unit at 1-916-654-6288 if you have questions on income credits.

---- ## I’m self-employed and I have DIEC. If I’m hurt on the job, will I receive DI benefits?:

Yes. DIEC benefits are payable whether you are hurt on or off the job unless you carry [workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) coverage for yourself.

---- ## If I’m collecting benefits under my DIEC plan and continue to receive income from my business, will SDI still pay me?:

You may continue to receive income or profits from your business and still be eligible for either DI or PFL benefits. Learn more about eligibility requirements for:

------- @MAIN_CONTENT:

### If my employee pays into State Disability Insurance but doesn’t live in California, are they still eligible for benefits?

### Does an employee have to work a minimum number of hours or days before becoming eligible for Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits?

No. The law does not require a minimum number of hours worked or days employed to qualify for benefits. However, your employee must have earned at least $300 from which State Disability Insurance deductions were withheld during their [claim base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/).

### Can employees receive Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits if they work part-time?

If your employees work part-time and still have a wage loss due to a disability or family leave, they may receive benefits provided they are otherwise eligible. State Disability Insurance, which includes Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave is a wage loss benefit program, which means that individuals may be eligible for a portion of the benefit if they have a loss of wages and meet the other eligibility requirements.

For more information visit the [Part-time/Intermittent/Reduced Work Schedule](/en/disability/part-time_intermittent_reduced_work_schedule/) page.

### Does the seven-day waiting period for Disability Insurance need to be consecutive days?

No. The required seven-day non-payable waiting period does not need to be taken seven days in a row. For example, if your employee worked full duty for four days and was unable to work one day per week, the seven-day waiting period would be served over a seven-week period. Benefits are payable once the seven days have been served and all other eligibility criteria are met.

If you are eligible, the EDD processes and issues payments within a few weeks of receiving a claim.

If another Disability Insurance claim is filed for the same or related cause or condition within 60 days of the initial claim, it will be processed as a continuation of the initial claim for which a waiting period was already served. There will not be a new waiting period in such cases.

**Note:** Paid Family Leave does not have a waiting period for benefits.

### Can I require my employees to take all of their Paid Family Leave benefits at one time?

No. The law does not require a minimum number of hours, days, or weeks that an employee must take Paid Family Leave benefits, it only established the maximum leave time of 8 paid weeks within a 12-month period.

### Are employees required by law to use their leave when collecting Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits?

Employees are not required to use vacation, paid time off, or sick leave when receiving Disability Insurance benefits.

However, when the employee is requesting Paid Family Leave, the law gives an employer the option to require an employee to take up to two weeks of earned, but unused, vacation leave and/or paid time off (PTO) prior to receiving PFL. This option does not relieve employers of any collective-bargaining duties they may have with respect to vacation leave.

The law does not permit employers to require the use of sick leave instead of vacation.

### Is an employee eligible for Paid Family Leave benefits if they have to provide care for a sick relative that is out-of-state or out-of-the-country?

Yes. A claim may be submitted for Paid Family Leave benefits to care for a seriously ill child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner who is out of the state or out of the country. Benefits may be payable provided the medical certificate is properly completed, establishes a need for care, and the employee is otherwise eligible.

### Can an employee opt out of the Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave program?

No. The State Disability Insurance (SDI) program and contributions are mandatory under the California Unemployment Insurance Code. There are two exceptions:

There are two exceptions:

* If you (the employer) or a majority of employees in your company apply for approval of a Voluntary Plan in place of SDI coverage. For more information, visit [Voluntary Plan Information](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/).
* If your employee adheres to the faith or teaching of a bona fide religious sect, denomination, or organization whose creed, tenets, or principles require dependence on prayer for healing, they may request an exemption. They must complete and mail the [*Religious Exemption Certificate* (DE 5067) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de5067.pdf) to the address on the form. If they are granted this exemption, they will not be eligible to receive SDI benefits.

### What is the Paid Parental Leave Ordinance?

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed the [Paid Parental Leave Ordinance (PPLO)](https://sf.gov/information/understanding-paid-parental-leave-ordinance) in April 2016. The ordinance requires employers to provide supplemental compensation to employees who are receiving California Paid Family Leave (PFL) for purposes of bonding with a new child through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.

During the leave period, covered employers are required to provide supplemental compensation so that the PFL compensation plus the supplemental compensation equals 100 percent of their employee’s gross weekly wage. Employers with 50 or more employees had to comply with the ordinance by January 1, 2017; employers with 35 or more employees by July 1, 2017; and employers with 20 or more employees by January 1, 2018.

Visit the City and County of San Francisco, [Office of Labor Standards Enforcement](https://sfgov.org/olse/) to learn more and view the [full text of the PPLO](https://sfgov.org/olse/paid-parental-leave-ordinance).

### How soon will my employee receive their first benefit payment from Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave after they submit their claim?

Benefit payments are normally issued within two weeks from the date we receive a properly completed claim online or by mail. If we need additional information, more time may be needed to process their claim.

### How does the EDD determine the weekly benefit amount?

We calculate the weekly benefit amount based on the calendar quarter with the highest earnings in your employee’s base period. The base period will include the employee wages paid approximately 5 to 18 months before the claim begins. The wages must be subject to the State Disability Insurance tax. The base period does not include wages paid at the time the claim begins.

* [Calculating (PFL) Benefit Payment Amounts](/en/disability/Calculating_PFL_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/)

### Can my employee receive other benefits at the same time as Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave?

In general, your employees may not receive Disability Insurance (DI) or Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits at the same time they are receiving [Unemployment Insurance (UI)](/en/unemployment/) or [workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) benefits. However, there are exceptions:

* If your employee’s weekly workers’ compensation benefit amount is less than their weekly DI or PFL benefit amount, they may be eligible to receive the difference between the two rates.
* Your employees may receive Social Security disability at the same time as DI. You can learn more from the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/) on Social Security disability eligibility requirements.
* Other benefits, such as employer paid benefits for baby bonding, may affect Paid Family Leave benefits.

### How are Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave benefits affected when an employee receives sick leave benefits at the same time?

We treat sick leave wages as wages earned. Disability Insurance (DI) and Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits will be reduced by the amount of sick leave wages received and may render the employee ineligible for benefits depending on the amount of sick leave wages received and the employee’s weekly benefit amount.

### Integration of Benefits

If you [integrate](/en/disability/integration-coordination/) the sick leave (pay the employee sick leave wages in an amount which is the difference between the SDI benefit and the employee's full wage), the sick leave benefits received by the employee will not affect the DI or PFL benefit.

### My company’s policy is to integrate unused sick leave with Disability and Paid Family Leave. Is this allowed?

Yes. For more information, visit [Integration of Benefits](/en/disability/integration-coordination/).

### Are Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave benefits reportable for tax purposes?

[Disability Insurance (DI)](/en/disability/disability_insurance/) benefits are not reportable for tax purposes with one exception: If your employee is receiving [Unemployment Insurance (UI)](/en/unemployment/) benefits, becomes unable to work due to a disability, and begins receiving DI benefits, their DI benefits are treated as a substitute for their UI benefits. The DI benefits will then be reportable for tax purposes.

If DI benefits are reportable, we will send a notice to your employee with the first benefit payment explaining that the benefits are being reported to the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](https://www.irs.gov/). In January, we will send the employee a [1099G form](/en/unemployment/Get_Tax_Information_Form_1099G/) showing the reportable amounts paid (no more than the original UI maximum) and forward a copy of the 1099G to the IRS.

Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits are reportable for federal tax purposes, but not state tax purposes. We will provide your employee with a 1099G form and forward a copy of the 1099G to the IRS. PFL benefits are not taxable or reportable to the [California State Franchise Tax Board](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/).

* If your employee adheres to the faith or teaching of a bona fide religious sect, denomination, or organization whose creed, tenets, or principles require dependence on prayer for healing, they may request an exemption. They must complete and mail the [*Religious Exemption Certificate* (DE 5067) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de5067.pdf) to the address on the form. If they are granted this exemption, they will not be eligible to receive SDI benefits.

---- ## What is the Paid Parental Leave Ordinance?:

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed the [Paid Parental Leave Ordinance (PPLO)](https://sf.gov/information/understanding-paid-parental-leave-ordinance) in April 2016. The ordinance requires employers to provide supplemental compensation to employees who are receiving California Paid Family Leave (PFL) for purposes of bonding with a new child through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.

During the leave period, covered employers are required to provide supplemental compensation so that the PFL compensation plus the supplemental compensation equals 100 percent of their employee’s gross weekly wage. Employers with 50 or more employees had to comply with the ordinance by January 1, 2017; employers with 35 or more employees by July 1, 2017; and employers with 20 or more employees by January 1, 2018.

Visit the City and County of San Francisco, [Office of Labor Standards Enforcement](https://sfgov.org/olse/) to learn more and view the [full text of the PPLO](https://sfgov.org/olse/paid-parental-leave-ordinance).

---- ## How soon will my employee receive their first benefit payment from Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave after they submit their claim?:

Benefit payments are normally issued within two weeks from the date we receive a properly completed claim online or by mail. If we need additional information, more time may be needed to process their claim.

---- ## How does the EDD determine the weekly benefit amount?:

We calculate the weekly benefit amount based on the calendar quarter with the highest earnings in your employee’s base period. The base period will include the employee wages paid approximately 5 to 18 months before the claim begins. The wages must be subject to the State Disability Insurance tax. The base period does not include wages paid at the time the claim begins.

---- ## Can my employee receive other benefits at the same time as Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave?:

In general, your employees may not receive Disability Insurance (DI) or Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits at the same time they are receiving [Unemployment Insurance (UI)](/en/unemployment/) or [workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) benefits. However, there are exceptions:

* If your employee’s weekly workers’ compensation benefit amount is less than their weekly DI or PFL benefit amount, they may be eligible to receive the difference between the two rates.
* Your employees may receive Social Security disability at the same time as DI. You can learn more from the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/) on Social Security disability eligibility requirements.
* Other benefits, such as employer paid benefits for baby bonding, may affect Paid Family Leave benefits.

---- ## How are Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave benefits affected when an employee receives sick leave benefits at the same time?:

We treat sick leave wages as wages earned. Disability Insurance (DI) and Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits will be reduced by the amount of sick leave wages received and may render the employee ineligible for benefits depending on the amount of sick leave wages received and the employee’s weekly benefit amount.

### Integration of Benefits

If you [integrate](/en/disability/integration-coordination/) the sick leave (pay the employee sick leave wages in an amount which is the difference between the SDI benefit and the employee's full wage), the sick leave benefits received by the employee will not affect the DI or PFL benefit.

---- ## My company’s policy is to integrate unused sick leave with Disability and Paid Family Leave. Is this allowed?:

Yes. For more information, visit [Integration of Benefits](/en/disability/integration-coordination/).

---- ## Are Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave benefits reportable for tax purposes?:

[Disability Insurance (DI)](/en/disability/disability_insurance/) benefits are not reportable for tax purposes with one exception: If your employee is receiving [Unemployment Insurance (UI)](/en/unemployment/) benefits, becomes unable to work due to a disability, and begins receiving DI benefits, their DI benefits are treated as a substitute for their UI benefits. The DI benefits will then be reportable for tax purposes.

If DI benefits are reportable, we will send a notice to your employee with the first benefit payment explaining that the benefits are being reported to the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](https://www.irs.gov/). In January, we will send the employee a [1099G form](/en/unemployment/Get_Tax_Information_Form_1099G/) showing the reportable amounts paid (no more than the original UI maximum) and forward a copy of the 1099G to the IRS.

Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits are reportable for federal tax purposes, but not state tax purposes. We will provide your employee with a 1099G form and forward a copy of the 1099G to the IRS. PFL benefits are not taxable or reportable to the [California State Franchise Tax Board](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/).
