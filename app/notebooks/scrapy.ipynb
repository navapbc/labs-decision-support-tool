The benefit amount and rules about using leave credits vary based on your employment status and bargaining unit.\\n\\nIf you participate in the California’s annual leave program, you are eligible to receive Enhanced NDI (ENDI) benefits of 50% of your gross pay. This can be supplemented with leave credits at 75% or 100%.\\n\\nState and federal taxes will be withheld from NDI benefits. Voluntary deductions, such as health insurance premiums, credit union loans, savings accounts, bonds, and parking fees, will automatically be deducted from NDI benefits unless you cancel. If you continue to deduct your health insurance premium, your employer’s contribution will also continue.\\n\\n### Get a Medical Certification\\n\\nMedical certifications are required for disability and caregiver claims to receive NDI or NDI-FCL benefits.\\n\\nUnlike SDI, NDI is not an automated program. Paper forms still need to be filled out to begin or extend the medical portion of a claim.\\n\\nTalk to your licensed health professional about their process for submitting a medical certification (not all medical offices follow the same steps or process).\\n\\n**Note:** Your claim is not complete until your licensed health professional completes a medical certification.\\n\\nYou can get medical extension forms by contacting us at 1-866-758-9768\\\\.\\n\\n### Additional Resources\\n\\nFor more information about NDI, refer to:\\n\\n* [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance FAQs](/en/disability/nonindustrial/faqs/)\\n* [Nonindustrial Disability Insurance Claim Process](/en/disability/nonindustrial/claim-process/)\\n* [Family Care Leave (NDI-FCL) Overview](/en/disability/nonindustrial/family-care-leave/)\\n* [CalHR](http://calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/non-industrial-disability-insurance.aspx)'}\n",

      "Integration of wages with Disability Insurance (DI) or Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits, also known as coordination or supplementation, is when an employee receives their full DI or PFL [weekly benefit amount](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/) and is also paid wages from their employer or uses available leave to cover the difference between their benefit amount and their regular wages. Visit [Integration of Benefits](/en/disability/integration-coordination/) for more information.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How much will an employee get with integration benefits?\n",
      "\n",
      "This process may allow you to receive up to 100 percent of your normal weekly salary during a period of disability or family leave while using a reduced amount of your leave balance or receiving wages from your employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:** Your current gross (before taxes and deductions) weekly wage is $500. The weekly benefit amount from PFL is $275. The $500 minus $275 equals a $225 per week wage loss. Your employer can integrate a maximum amount of $225 per week in gross wages to you, allowing you to receive up to 100 percent of your normal weekly gross pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the integration process is used by your employer, and we confirm this process, we will pay your full DI or PFL benefits.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** It is the responsibility of both you and your employer to make sure that you are not receiving more than 100 percent of your normal weekly salary when receiving integrated wages along with the DI or PFL weekly benefit amount. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Can the EDD tell an employer how much an employee is getting in DI or PFL benefits?\n",
      "\n",
      "We may give this information to an employer if their employee provides written permission on their initial DI or PFL claim forms. The employee must answer **Yes** to the question, “May we disclose benefit payment information to your employer(s)?” when completing their claim form. If the employer integrates with DI or PFL, they need this information to make sure the right amount of wages are paid to the employee. \n",
      "\n",
      "An employee can also submit a separate written letter giving us permission to disclose benefit payment information to their employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "## What does the law require for wage integration with DI and PFL?\n",
      "\n",
      "DI and PFL are partial wage-replacement programs, meaning that if an employee takes time off work due to a disability or the need to care for a seriously ill family member, bond with a new child, or participate in a qualifying military event, they must have a wage loss to qualify for benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wages received during this time, plus DI or PFL benefits, cannot be more than the employee’s normal weekly salary (excluding overtime pay) before the start of the disability or family leave period.\n",
      "\n",
      "To review the law, visit [California Unemployment Insurance Code Section 2656](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=UIC&division=1.&title=&part=2.&chapter=2.&article=2.).\n",
      "\n",
      "## What types of payments or benefits are considered wages that need to be reported?\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common types of payments are sick leave, bereavement pay, back pay, and earnings (full or partial return to work). For more information, visit [Reporting Your Wages or Work Status for DI](/en/disability/Reporting_Your_Wages_DI/) and [Reporting Your Wages - PFL](/en/disability/Reporting_Your_Wages_PFL/).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** Employees can use leave credits such as sick leave, vacation, and other paid time off to add to their claim benefits. Leave credits can be used during the seven-day waiting period for DI claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Can an employee receive vacation benefits from their employer and still receive DI or PFL benefits?\n",
      "\n",
      "DI - Yes. Vacation benefits are not in conflict with DI.\n",
      "\n",
      "PFL - Yes. Vacation can be used to supplement your PFL benefits so you can receive up to 100 percent pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your employer may require you to use up to two weeks of vacation before receiving PFL benefits. If your employer requires that you use vacation first, you won’t receive PFL benefits for those days. You will receive PFL benefits after you have used the vacation leave required by your employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Can an employee receive sick leave or other paid leave from their employer and still receive DI or PFL benefits?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, but depending on the type of paid leave and how much you receive, your DI or PFL benefits may be reduced or denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Vacation Pay:** You can receive DI benefits at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sick Pay:** You cannot receive DI benefits if you also receive sick leave wages that equal your full salary. If you receive only partial sick leave wages, you may be eligible for full or partial DI benefits.\n",

      "We may give this information to an employer if their employee provides written permission on their initial DI or PFL claim forms. The employee must answer **Yes** to the question, “May we disclose benefit payment information to your employer(s)?” when completing their claim form. If the employer integrates with DI or PFL, they need this information to make sure the right amount of wages are paid to the employee. \n",
      "\n",
      "An employee can also submit a separate written letter giving us permission to disclose benefit payment information to their employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## What does the law require for wage integration with DI and PFL?:\n",
      "\n",
      "DI and PFL are partial wage-replacement programs, meaning that if an employee takes time off work due to a disability or the need to care for a seriously ill family member, bond with a new child, or participate in a qualifying military event, they must have a wage loss to qualify for benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wages received during this time, plus DI or PFL benefits, cannot be more than the employee’s normal weekly salary (excluding overtime pay) before the start of the disability or family leave period.\n",
      "\n",
      "To review the law, visit [California Unemployment Insurance Code Section 2656](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=UIC&division=1.&title=&part=2.&chapter=2.&article=2.).\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## What types of payments or benefits are considered wages that need to be reported?:\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common types of payments are sick leave, bereavement pay, back pay, and earnings (full or partial return to work). For more information, visit [Reporting Your Wages or Work Status for DI](/en/disability/Reporting_Your_Wages_DI/) and [Reporting Your Wages - PFL](/en/disability/Reporting_Your_Wages_PFL/).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** Employees can use leave credits such as sick leave, vacation, and other paid time off to add to their claim benefits. Leave credits can be used during the seven-day waiting period for DI claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Can an employee receive vacation benefits from their employer and still receive DI or PFL benefits?:\n",
      "\n",
      "DI - Yes. Vacation benefits are not in conflict with DI.\n",
      "\n",
      "PFL - Yes. Vacation can be used to supplement your PFL benefits so you can receive up to 100 percent pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your employer may require you to use up to two weeks of vacation before receiving PFL benefits. If your employer requires that you use vacation first, you won’t receive PFL benefits for those days. You will receive PFL benefits after you have used the vacation leave required by your employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Can an employee receive sick leave or other paid leave from their employer and still receive DI or PFL benefits?:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, but depending on the type of paid leave and how much you receive, your DI or PFL benefits may be reduced or denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Vacation Pay:** You can receive DI benefits at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Sick Pay:** You cannot receive DI benefits if you also receive sick leave wages that equal your full salary. If you receive only partial sick leave wages, you may be eligible for full or partial DI benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Other Pay:** All other pay, including holiday pay, must be reported to confirm your eligibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first seven days of your DI claim is a non-payable waiting period. Any type of wages paid by the employer during the waiting period do not conflict with DI benefits.\n",

      "Your weekly benefit amount is about 60 to 70 percent (depending on income) of wages earned 5 to 18 months before your claim start date, up to the maximum weekly benefit amount. You must have been paying SDI taxes on these wages (usually noted as CASDI on your paystub). Your base period does not include wages paid at the time your disability begins.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes. To use Paid Family Leave benefits intermittently while working part time, check “yes” to question A13 on the *Claim for Paid Family Leave Benefits* (DE 2501F) form or “yes” to question 6 on the *Claim for Paid Family Leave (Paid Family Leave ) Benefits – New Mother* (DE 2501FP) form. If filing online, check “yes” to the question, “Will you work at any time during your family leave?” You should also attach a detailed note to your claim form explaining which days you will work and the number of hours to be worked each day.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, if you voluntarily quit your job to care for a family member with a serious health condition, you can receive PFL if you are eligible and submit a timely claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be eligible, you must have paid into the State Disability Insurance Fund during your base period, and you must experience a wage loss because of your need to care for your seriously ill parent, child, spouse, registered domestic partner, sibling, parent-in-law, grandchild, or grandparent.  You also must be attached to the labor market before your PFL claim, which means 90 days before the start of your PFL claim. You must be employed, looking or registered for work, or have an active Unemployment Insurance or Disability Insurance claim. You will need to provide a medical certification documenting your family member’s illness. Find more information about eligibility requirements and how to apply [here](/en/disability/Am_I_Eligible_for_PFL_Benefits/).\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, but not at the same time. If you voluntarily quit your job to care for an ill family member, you should first apply for PFL benefits (see FAQ above.) If you are still unemployed after your final PFL benefit payment, you can then apply for unemployment benefits as long as you are still out of work, ready and available to accept work, and otherwise eligible for UI. \n",
      "\n",
      "To be eligible for UI, you will have to show “good cause” for voluntarily quitting work due to compelling caregiving responsibilities. This means you had a compelling caregiving responsibility that caused you to quit your job and you took reasonable steps to preserve your job before quitting.  Compelling caregiving responsibilities include, but are not limited to:\n",
      "\n",
      "* A member of your family is seriously ill, disabled, or in danger of death.\n",
      "* You need to move to care for a family member who is seriously ill or disabled, making it impossible or impractical for you to commute to work.\n",
      "* You need to attend a funeral, make final arrangements, or attend to the final affairs of a member of your family who has died.\n",
      "* A member of your family is elderly and unable to care for their self.\n",
      "* Your minor child requires care/supervision and there is no reasonable alternative.\n",
      "* There is a need to preserve family unity.\n",
      "\n",
      "To establish “good cause,” you will also have to show that you quit your job for a compelling reason (e.g., quit to take care of a family member and no one else was available to provide care). Additionally, before quitting, you will also need to show you took reasonable steps to preserve your job—meaning, you first asked your employer for a leave of absence, accommodation, or transfer that would have allowed you to keep your job and care for your family member.  If you attempted to preserve your job by asking for a leave of absence, accommodation, or transfer, but your employer did not have these options available, this would still demonstrate you attempted to preserve your employment before quitting.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are two exceptions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* If your employer or a majority of employees in your company apply for approval of a Voluntary Plan in place of SDI coverage. For more information visit: [Voluntary Plan Information](/en/disability/Employer_Voluntary_Plans/).\n",

      "The EDD makes every effort to process your Paid Family Leave (PFL) payment within 14 days of receiving your complete initial claim. Your employer may require that you use up to two weeks of vacation leave or paid time off (PTO) prior to receiving Paid Family Leave benefits. Paid Family Leave benefits can start immediately after your vacation leave/PTO ends.\n",

      "\n",
      "A serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care in a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility, or at home. This includes any period of incapacity (e.g., inability to work, attend school, or perform other regular daily activities) or any subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care; or continuing treatment by a physician or practitioner.\n",

      "\n",
      "Not necessarily. Your employer may require you to take up to two weeks of unused vacation leave and/or PTO before receiving Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits, but you should check with your human resources department first, since all employers are different. That said, your employer cannot require you to use sick leave before receiving PFL benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may be able to take unused sick leave and receive PFL benefits at the same time, but the combined benefits cannot exceed 100 percent of your regular earnings or your PFL benefits will be reduced by the amount of sick leave wages received.

      "* A period of family leave overlaps with a school break and the employee is not scheduled to work, does not have a history of working during the break, or does not have an additional employer.\n",
      "* The family leave period extends through the school break period.\n",
      "\n",

      "## Family Care Leave\n",
      "\n",
      "NDI-FCL is for eligible California State employees, excluded from bargaining, who need to take time off work for family leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "------- @ACCORDIONS:\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Can I participate in either State Disability Insurance (SDI), NDI, or Enhanced Nonindustrial Insurance (ENDI)?:\n",
      "\n",
      "No. You cannot choose your disability program. It is determined by your employment position and bargaining unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Will the State continue to contribute to my health, dental, and vision benefits if I am unable to work and receive NDI benefits?:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are enrolled in the Annual Leave Program (ALP), your employer will continue to pay benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are not enrolled in the ALP, you must have leave credits to continue your benefits. If you do not have enough leave credits, your benefits will stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once NDI benefits are approved, you should direct all other employee benefit questions, including your health, dental and vision benefits to your attendance clerk or personnel office.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Is NDI taxable?:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. Your NDI benefits will be included as wages on your W-2.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Can I work and receive NDI benefits?:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. If you work reduced hours or have a change in how you perform your work because of a disability and you have a wage loss, you may be eligible for benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Can I receive annual leave credits while receiving NDI benefits?:\n",
      "\n",
      "No. If you are receiving NDI benefits, you will not accrue annual leave credits unless you work partial hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## If I am employed by the State of California, but live and work in another state, am I covered by NDI?:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. If you are in a covered bargaining unit and are otherwise eligible for NDI, you can file a claim and receive benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Can I buy back NDI or SDI time for retirement?:\n",
      "\n",
      "You must contact [CalPERS](https://www.calpers.ca.gov/) to discuss your [service credit](https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/active-members/retirement-benefits/service-credit) purchase options.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Can I be on NDI and still file a claim for NDI-FCL?:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. If you are on NDI, you can [file a claim](/en/disability/nonindustrial/family-care-leave/) for NDI-FCL. We will determine if you are eligible. However, benefits for both programs cannot be paid on the same day.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Can I file a claim for both NDI and SDI?:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. There are times when you are [eligible](/en/disability/nonindustrial/) for both NDI and SDI, such as moving from one bargaining unit to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Is there a waiting period before I receive benefits?:\n",
      "\n",
      "No. NDI-FCL does not require a waiting period before you can be paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Can I file a bonding claim and a caregiver claim?:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. You can file both claims, but you are only eligible to receive a combined maximum of 8 weeks (56 days) in a 12-month period. Your bonding claim and caregiver claim cannot overlap.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## What is the difference between NDI-FCL and ENDI?:\n",
      "\n",
      "NDI-FCL benefits are only available to excluded employees or an employee represented by a specific bargaining unit that has FCL language in their Memorandum of Understanding and who are not able to participate in the California State Disability Insurance Paid Family Leave program. Only the state employees mentioned above who are enrolled in the Annual Leave Program are eligible for these benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "NDI-FCL provides up to six weeks of benefits in a 12-month period for employees who are excluded from bargaining and need to take time off work for family leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "NDI-FCL does not require a 7 or 10-day waiting period before benefits are payable.\n",
      "\n",
      "ENDI provides up to 26 weeks of benefits for a qualifying medical disability and requires a 7 or 10-day waiting period before benefits are paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Is the claim process for NDI-FCL and ENDI the same?:\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. The claim process, the roles and responsibilities of the personnel offices, and how the benefits are paid are the same as the ENDI program.\n",

      "### Does an employee have to work a minimum number of hours or days before becoming eligible for Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits?\n",
      "\n",
      "No. The law does not require a minimum number of hours worked or days employed to qualify for benefits.

      "\n",
      "If your employees work part-time and still have a wage loss due to a disability or family leave, they may receive benefits provided they are otherwise eligible. State Disability Insurance, which includes Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave is a wage loss benefit program, which means that individuals may be eligible for a portion of the benefit if they have a loss of wages and meet the other eligibility requirements.\n",

      "\n",
      "No. The required seven-day non-payable waiting period does not need to be taken seven days in a row. For example, if your employee worked full duty for four days and was unable to work one day per week, the seven-day waiting period would be served over a seven-week period. Benefits are payable once the seven days have been served and all other eligibility criteria are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are eligible, the EDD processes and issues payments within a few weeks of receiving a claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "If another Disability Insurance claim is filed for the same or related cause or condition within 60 days of the initial claim, it will be processed as a continuation of the initial claim for which a waiting period was already served. There will not be a new waiting period in such cases.\n",

      "**Note:** Paid Family Leave does not have a waiting period for benefits.\n",

      "### Can I require my employees to take all of their Paid Family Leave benefits at one time?\n",
      "\n",
      "No. The law does not require a minimum number of hours, days, or weeks that an employee must take Paid Family Leave benefits, it only established the maximum leave time of 8 paid weeks within a 12-month period.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Are employees required by law to use their leave when collecting Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits?\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees are not required to use vacation, paid time off, or sick leave when receiving Disability Insurance benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when the employee is requesting Paid Family Leave, the law gives an employer the option to require an employee to take up to two weeks of earned, but unused, vacation leave and/or paid time off (PTO) prior to receiving PFL. This option does not relieve employers of any collective-bargaining duties they may have with respect to vacation leave.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes. A claim may be submitted for Paid Family Leave benefits to care for a seriously ill child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner who is out of the state or out of the country. Benefits may be payable provided the medical certificate is properly completed, establishes a need for care, and the employee is otherwise eligible.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Can an employee opt out of the Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave program?\n",

      "### What is the Paid Parental Leave Ordinance?\n",
      "\n",
      "The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed the [Paid Parental Leave Ordinance (PPLO)](https://sf.gov/information/understanding-paid-parental-leave-ordinance) in April 2016. The ordinance requires employers to provide supplemental compensation to employees who are receiving California Paid Family Leave (PFL) for purposes of bonding with a new child through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the leave period, covered employers are required to provide supplemental compensation so that the PFL compensation plus the supplemental compensation equals 100 percent of their employee’s gross weekly wage. Employers with 50 or more employees had to comply with the ordinance by January 1, 2017; employers with 35 or more employees by July 1, 2017; and employers with 20 or more employees by January 1, 2018.\n",

      "Benefit payments are normally issued within two weeks from the date we receive a properly completed claim online or by mail. If we need additional information, more time may be needed to process their claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How does the EDD determine the weekly benefit amount?\n",
      "\n",
      "We calculate the weekly benefit amount based on the calendar quarter with the highest earnings in your employee’s base period. The base period will include the employee wages paid approximately 5 to 18 months before the claim begins. The wages must be subject to the State Disability Insurance tax. The base period does not include wages paid at the time the claim begins.\n",

      "\n",
      "In general, your employees may not receive Disability Insurance (DI) or Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits at the same time they are receiving [Unemployment Insurance (UI)](/en/unemployment/) or [workers’ compensation](/en/disability/Employer_Workers_Compensation/) benefits. However, there are exceptions:\n",

      "\n",
      "### How are Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave benefits affected when an employee receives sick leave benefits at the same time?\n",
      "\n",
      "We treat sick leave wages as wages earned. Disability Insurance (DI) and Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits will be reduced by the amount of sick leave wages received and may render the employee ineligible for benefits depending on the amount of sick leave wages received and the employee’s weekly benefit amount.\n",

      "### Integration of Benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "If you [integrate](/en/disability/integration-coordination/) the sick leave (pay the employee sick leave wages in an amount which is the difference between the SDI benefit and the employee's full wage), the sick leave benefits received by the employee will not affect the DI or PFL benefit.\n",

The DI benefits will then be reportable for tax purposes.\n",

      "If DI benefits are reportable, we will send a notice to your employee with the first benefit payment explaining that the benefits are being reported to the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](https://www.irs.gov/). In January, we will send the employee a [1099G form](/en/unemployment/Get_Tax_Information_Form_1099G/) showing the reportable amounts paid (no more than the original UI maximum) and forward a copy of the 1099G to the IRS.\n",

      "---- ## Does an employee have to work a minimum number of hours or days before becoming eligible for Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits?:\n",
      "\n",
      "No. The law does not require a minimum number of hours worked or days employed to qualify for benefits. However, your employee must have earned at least $300 from which State Disability Insurance deductions were withheld during their [claim base period](/en/disability/Calculating_DI_Benefit_Payment_Amounts/).\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Can employees receive Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits if they work part-time?:\n",
      "\n",
      "If your employees work part-time and still have a wage loss due to a disability or family leave, they may receive benefits provided they are otherwise eligible. State Disability Insurance, which includes Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave is a wage loss benefit program, which means that individuals may be eligible for a portion of the benefit if they have a loss of wages and meet the other eligibility requirements.\n",

      "---- ## Does the seven-day waiting period for Disability Insurance need to be consecutive days?:\n",
      "\n",
      "No. The required seven-day non-payable waiting period does not need to be taken seven days in a row. For example, if your employee worked full duty for four days and was unable to work one day per week, the seven-day waiting period would be served over a seven-week period. Benefits are payable once the seven days have been served and all other eligibility criteria are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are eligible, the EDD processes and issues payments within a few weeks of receiving a claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "If another Disability Insurance claim is filed for the same or related cause or condition within 60 days of the initial claim, it will be processed as a continuation of the initial claim for which a waiting period was already served. There will not be a new waiting period in such cases.\n",

      "---- ## Can I require my employees to take all of their Paid Family Leave benefits at one time?:\n",
      "\n",
      "No. The law does not require a minimum number of hours, days, or weeks that an employee must take Paid Family Leave benefits, it only established the maximum leave time of 8 paid weeks within a 12-month period.\n",
      "\n",
      "---- ## Are employees required by law to use their leave when collecting Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave benefits?:\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees are not required to use vacation, paid time off, or sick leave when receiving Disability Insurance benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when the employee is requesting Paid Family Leave, the law gives an employer the option to require an employee to take up to two weeks of earned, but unused, vacation leave and/or paid time off (PTO) prior to receiving PFL. This option does not relieve employers of any collective-bargaining duties they may have with respect to vacation leave.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes. A claim may be submitted for Paid Family Leave benefits to care for a seriously ill child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner who is out of the state or out of the country. Benefits may be payable provided the medical certificate is properly completed, establishes a need for care, and the employee is otherwise eligible.\n",

      "---- ## Can an employee opt out of the Disability Insurance or Paid Family Leave program?:\n",

They must complete and mail the [*Religious Exemption Certificate* (DE 5067) (PDF)](/siteassets/files/pdf_pub_ctr/de5067.pdf) to the address on the form. If they are granted this exemption, they will not be eligible to receive SDI benefits.\n",

      "---- ## What is the Paid Parental Leave Ordinance?:\n",
      "\n",
      "The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed the [Paid Parental Leave Ordinance (PPLO)](https://sf.gov/information/understanding-paid-parental-leave-ordinance) in April 2016. The ordinance requires employers to provide supplemental compensation to employees who are receiving California Paid Family Leave (PFL) for purposes of bonding with a new child through birth, adoption, or foster care placement.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the leave period, covered employers are required to provide supplemental compensation so that the PFL compensation plus the supplemental compensation equals 100 percent of their employee’s gross weekly wage. Employers with 50 or more employees had to comply with the ordinance by January 1, 2017; employers with 35 or more employees by July 1, 2017; and employers with 20 or more employees by January 1, 2018.\n",

      "---- ## How does the EDD determine the weekly benefit amount?:\n",
      "\n",
      "We calculate the weekly benefit amount based on the calendar quarter with the highest earnings in your employee’s base period. The base period will include the employee wages paid approximately 5 to 18 months before the claim begins. The wages must be subject to the State Disability Insurance tax.

However, there are exceptions:\n",

      "* If your employee’s weekly workers’ compensation benefit amount is less than their weekly DI or PFL benefit amount, they may be eligible to receive the difference between the two rates.\n",

      "---- ## How are Disability Insurance and Paid Family Leave benefits affected when an employee receives sick leave benefits at the same time?:\n",
      "\n",
      "We treat sick leave wages as wages earned. Disability Insurance (DI) and Paid Family Leave (PFL) benefits will be reduced by the amount of sick leave wages received and may render the employee ineligible for benefits depending on the amount of sick leave wages received and the employee’s weekly benefit amount.\n",

      "If you [integrate](/en/disability/integration-coordination/) the sick leave (pay the employee sick leave wages in an amount which is the difference between the SDI benefit and the employee's full wage), the sick leave benefits received by the employee will not affect the DI or PFL benefit.\n",

The DI benefits will then be reportable for tax purposes.\n",
